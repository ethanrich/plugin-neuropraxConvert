%% @defun harmonic (@var{x})
%% Numerical harmonic function.
%%
%% Example:
%% @example
%% @group
%% harmonic (1.1)
%%   @result{} ans = 1.0626
%% @end group
%% @end example
%%
%% @strong{Note} this function may be slow for large numbers of inputs.
%% This is because it is not a native double-precision implementation
%% but rather the numerical evaluation of the Python @code{mpmath} function
%% @code{harmonic}.
%%
%% Note: this file is autogenerated: if you want to edit it, you might
%% want to make changes to 'generate_functions.py' instead.
