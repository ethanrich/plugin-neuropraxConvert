<p>These functions show the essential steps of using MOD for
detecting EPSP/EPSCs as described in [1] and applied in [2]. </p>

<p>In order to run this demo, the following software packages are needed: </p>

<ul>
<li>Octave (or Matlab) and the Signal Processing toolbox or package</li>
<li>Biosig [3]</li>
<li>NaN-toolbox [4] </li>
<li>SigViewer [5] - for scoring the data and visualization of the resulting detections
(either v0.5.1, or the most recent version from git repo)</li>
<li>Example data (from [1,2]) is available from [6] </li>
</ul>

<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>How to apply it to your own data</h2>

<p>This depends whether you want to build a detector for each cell, or whether you want to build a general classifier.</p>

<h3>Cell-based classifier:</h3>

<p>Check out demo_mod.m and address these items: </p>

<p>1) you need your raw data, and your scorings and adapt loading the data (lines 67-87)
Please note, the scorings consists of two periods (one segment in the beginning, the other from the end)
And you need to tell which periods are scored, when constructing the scoring trace
lines 124-136.</p>

<p>2) In case you want to apply blanking of AP&#39;s, you need to detect them and
replace them with NaN&#39;s (line 88-90, 115-123)</p>

<p>3) if you want to downsample your data, you can check the lines 92-114,</p>

<p>4) If you want to apply cross-validation, you should enable lines 140 - 194</p>

<p>That should do it. The main data processing of training the detection method happens in lines  199-213, the remainder storing the results,
and in case you still have some HF noise in the raw detection trace, you might want to smooth it before doing the event detection.</p>

<h3>General classifier:</h3>

<p>Check out demo_modx.m and address these items: </p>

<p>1) loading of data, where is your data located, how to load it.<br>
   define the grouping information, this is useful for the cross-validation later</p>

<p>2) get the scorings, identify which parts of the data is scored</p>

<p>3) proprocessing, detection artifacts, AP etc. and remove (blank) those. </p>

<p>4) run training and testing procedure on the scored data, use Leave-one-out-method for cross-validation. </p>

<p>5) Build the general classifier from all scored data. </p>

<h2>Is the output in the text file simply the event timings?</h2>

<p>Yes, the event timing can be found in multiple outputs.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>on the workspace its in the variable &ldquo;pos&rdquo;,</p></li>
<li><p>and its also stored in all three output files, in one way or another.</p>

<p>output/*.mat    contains various results, including the variable &#39;pos&#39;</p>

<p>output/*.txt    is the event times in seconds</p>

<p>output/*.gdf    is best viewed with sigviewer, but can be also loaded into matlab</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>2022-03-02:
    - demo<em>modx added
    - shows the use of leave-one-out-method for crossvalidation
    - add 6 data sets, with 2 scorings each
    - use accovf</em>mex to speed up training step</p>

<p>2021-06-21:
    improve documentation</p>
