%   Example

%     pts = transformPoint3d(pts, createScaling3d([6 4 2]));
%     pts = transformPoint3d(pts, createRotationOx(pi/6));

%     pts = transformPoint3d(pts, createRotationOz(pi/3));
%     pts = transformPoint3d(pts, createTranslation3d([5 4 3]));
%     elli = equivalentEllipsoid(pts);
%     figure; drawPoint3d(pts); axis equal;
%     hold on; drawEllipsoid(elli, ...
%         'drawEllipses', true, 'EllipseColor', 'b', 'EllipseWidth', 3);
