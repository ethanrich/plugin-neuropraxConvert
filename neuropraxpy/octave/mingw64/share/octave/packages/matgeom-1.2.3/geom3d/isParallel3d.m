function b = isParallel3d(v1, v2, varargin)
%ISPARALLEL3D Check parallelism of two 3D vectors.
%
%   B = isParallel3d(V1, V2)
%   where V1 and V2 are 2 [1x3] arrays, returns 1 if the vectors are
%   parallels, and 0 otherwise.
%
%   Also works when V1 and V2 are two [Nx3] arrays with same number of
%   rows. In this case, return a [Nx1] array containing 1 at the positions
%   of parallel vectors.
%
%   Also works when one of V1 or V2 is scalar and the other one is [Nx3]
%   array, in this case return [Nx1] results.
%
%   B = isPerpendicular3d(V1, V2, TOL)
%   Specifies the absolute tolerance (default is 1e-14).
%
%   Example
%   isParallel3d([1 2 1], [2 4 2])
%   ans =
%       1
%
%   isParallel3d([1 2 1], [1 3 2])
%   ans =
%       0
