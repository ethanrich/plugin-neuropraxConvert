%POLYGONS3D Description of functions operating on 3D polygons.
%
%   A 3D polygon is simply a set of 3D points (called vertices) which are
%   assumed to be located in the same plane.
%   Several functions are provided for computing basic geometrical
%   parameters (centroid, angles), or intersections with lines or planes.
