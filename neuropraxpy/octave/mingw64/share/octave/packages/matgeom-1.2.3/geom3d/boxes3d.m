%BOXES3D Description of functions operating on 3D boxes.
%
%   A box defined by its coordinate extents: 
%   BOX = [XMIN XMAX YMIN YMAX ZMIN ZMAX].
%
%   Example
%   % Draw a polyhedron together with its bounding box   
%   [n e f]= createIcosahedron;
%   drawPolyhedron(n, f);
%   hold on;
%   drawBox3d(point3dBounds(n))
