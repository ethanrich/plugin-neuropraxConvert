Summary of important user-visible changes for mapping 1.4.2:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions are new in mapping 1.4.2:
      almanac
      areaquad
      auth2geo
      con2geo
      geo2auth
      geo2con
      geo2iso
      geo2rect
      geodeticarc
      geodeticfwd
      iso2geo
      meridianfwd
      rect2geo
      referenceSphere
      sph_chk
      vincenty
      vincentyDirect

 ** Bug fixes
    - referenceEllipsoid.m: express semimajor axis of Everest 1830 in
      meters rather than the original 'Indian feet'
    - kmlread.m: fix typo when reading Point data
    - shapedraw.m: fix erratic (0, 0) coordinates occurring in plots
    - shaperead.m: improve reading attributes (bug #61757)

 ** Code improvements
    - referenceEllipsoid: return no output to screen if called with
      just 0 (zero) and an output is requested.  Abbreviations for a
      few ellipsoids were added.
    - replace validation of input reference ellipsoids by calls to
      sph_chk.m in several tens of geodesy functions. This makes for
      a big code reduction but also adds flexibility for inputting
      reference ellipsoids and/or reference sphere.

 ** Bug fixes:
      * gpxread.m  (bug #58701):
        - read milliseconds in Time nodes in Tracks, if present.
          Time fields in Waypoint sections are still ignored.
        - Various other fixes (missing Ele(vation) and Time nodes,
          texinfo help text).
      * kmlread.m (bug #58854):
        - Accept various mixed time formats.
        - Be more flexible regarding missing fields.
        Note: kmlread.m is still considered experimental.
        Thanks to Geoff Warne for supplying numerous .gpx and .kml
        test files and aid in diagnosing issues.
      * roundn.m: much improved Matlab-compatibility
      * angl2str.m: ditto, thanks to Ricardo Fantin da Costa
      * shapedraw: fix some Point geometry plotting logic, return
        empty file handle in case of empty shapes

 ** Code improvements
      * distance.m: improve accuracy for small distances


Summary of important user-visible changes for mapping 1.4.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

    (suggested) dependency on the octclip package has been removed.

 ** Bug fixes:
      shapedraw.m:  * Fix color arg. bug when drawing (poly)line
                      geometries.
                    * Restore input check order.
                    * Do not connect multipoint shapes.
      shaperead.m:  * Fix reading 'line' geometries.
                    * Ignore shapes with (almost) infinite
                      coordinates.
                    * Fix .shx file usage.
                    * Move file existence check to start of function.
                    * Fix reading MultiPoint shapefiles.
                    * Provision for absent M-values in M and Z
                      shapetypes.
                    * More robust input validation.
                    * Properly process BoundingBox limits.
                    * Fix incompatible dimensions bug when reading Multipoint files.
                    * Fix reading selected attributes.
      shapewrite.m: * Various fixes (credits to a.o., Martin Kunz, M.Parkan).
                    * Properly write missing M-values.
                    * Fix OOM error when writing large Point type files.
                    * Fix and overhaul writing requested attributes.
                    Fixes for bug #53422:
                    * Unconditionally write .dbf file.
                    * Fix record lengths for all Point types.
                    * Fix XY coordinate write order for all Multipoint types.
                    * Update .shx header as well.
       rasterinfo.m: Show nr. of bands and bounding box.

 ** Code improvements
      shaperead.m:  * Invoke the Clipper library for clipping polylines
                      and polygons, leading to much improved performance
                      when invoking the BoundingBox option together with
                      the Clip option. To use this feature the Octave-
                      Forge geometry package >= 4.0.0 must be installed
                      and loaded.

 ** New features
      shapewrite.m: * Allow writing M & Z shape types (Matlab-incompatible
                      types, yet supported by Octave).

Summary of important user-visible changes for mapping 1.2.1:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions are new in mapping 1.2.1:

      rasterread
      rasterinfo
      rasterdraw
      gdalread
      wrapToPi
      wrapTo2Pi
      wrapTo180
      wrapTo360

 ** New features
      Reading GIS raster data:  A first go is provided using
      functions rasterread.m and rasterinfo.m.  Both invoke binary
      function gdalread() of which an initial version was provided
      by Shashank Khare.  rasterread.m and rasterinfo.m can read
      and return info on any raster data type that the underlying
      GDAL library can read.  As such, separate functions for e.g.,
      GeoTIFF and ArcGrid etc. are not required.
      To make use of these functions the GDAL library must be
      present on your system => GDAL is a suggested dependency.

      mapshow.m: drawing raster data is now supported.

      shapedraw.m: drawing speed of filled polygons and multipatches
      is much improved

      wrapTo180.m, wrapTo360.m, wrapToPi.m, wrapTo2Pi.m:  Provided
      by Oscar Monerris Belda and turned into their present versions
      with help of a.o., Andreas Weber
                   
 ** Bug fixes:
      shapewrite.m: correct Lat/Lon mix-up
                    update overall BoundingBox for Point type
      shaperead.m:  improve reading Nr. of parts (of Polylines/-gons)

 ** To avoid shadowing core functions rad2deg and deg2rad, these
      functions are only copied into place if Octave (< 4.2) does not
      have them.

      
Summary of important user-visible changes for mapping 1.2.0:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The following functions are new in mapping 1.2.0:

      deg2km
      degtorad
      degrees2dm
      degrees2dms
      dm2degrees
      dms2degrees

      sm2rad
      sm2deg
      toDegrees
      toRadians
      unitsratio
      validateLengthUnit

 ** The function `distance' has been greatly improved with more options
    including calculating the azimuth between points and support different
    angle units.

 ** The function km2deg can accept an optional radius or the name of some
    Solar System objects.

 ** Test functions for deg2rad, km2deg and rad2deg have been added.
 
 ** Functions shapeinfo, shaperead, shapewrite and shapedraw are meant to
    process ArcGIS shape files. Functions mapshow and geoshow are simple
    Matlab-compatible wrappers for shapedraw. A basic implementation of
    makesymbolspec is also present.
    For some functionality of shaperead.m, shapewrite.m and shapedraw.m 
    the Octave-Forge geometry, io and octclip packages are required.

    The shape* functions are considered experimental yet. Only projected
    data files can be drawn and several limitations apply. On the other
    hand some functionality is present that supersedes ML compatibility.
    See the help for each function.
