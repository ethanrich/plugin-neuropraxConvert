19.4 Accumulation
=================

Whenever it’s possible to categorize according to indices the elements
of an array when performing a computation, accumulation functions can be
useful.

 -- : accumarray (SUBS, VALS, SZ, FUNC, FILLVAL, ISSPARSE)
 -- : accumarray (SUBS, VALS, ...)

     Create an array by accumulating the elements of a vector into the
     positions defined by their subscripts.

     The subscripts are defined by the rows of the matrix SUBS and the
     values by VALS.  Each row of SUBS corresponds to one of the values
     in VALS.  If VALS is a scalar, it will be used for each of the row
     of SUBS.  If SUBS is a cell array of vectors, all vectors must be
     of the same length, and the subscripts in the Kth vector must
     correspond to the Kth dimension of the result.

     The size of the matrix will be determined by the subscripts
     themselves.  However, if SZ is defined it determines the matrix
     size.  The length of SZ must correspond to the number of columns in
     SUBS.  An exception is if SUBS has only one column, in which case
     SZ may be the dimensions of a vector and the subscripts of SUBS are
     taken as the indices into it.

     The default action of ‘accumarray’ is to sum the elements with the
     same subscripts.  This behavior can be modified by defining the
     FUNC function.  This should be a function or function handle that
     accepts a column vector and returns a scalar.  The result of the
     function should not depend on the order of the subscripts.

     The elements of the returned array that have no subscripts
     associated with them are set to zero.  Defining FILLVAL to some
     other value allows these values to be defined.  This behavior
     changes, however, for certain values of FUNC.  If FUNC is ‘@min’
     (respectively, ‘@max’) then the result will be filled with the
     minimum (respectively, maximum) integer if VALS is of integral
     type, logical false (respectively, logical true) if VALS is of
     logical type, zero if FILLVAL is zero and all values are
     non-positive (respectively, non-negative), and NaN otherwise.

     By default ‘accumarray’ returns a full matrix.  If ISSPARSE is
     logically true, then a sparse matrix is returned instead.

     The following ‘accumarray’ example constructs a frequency table
     that in the first column counts how many occurrences each number in
     the second column has, taken from the vector X.  Note the usage of
     ‘unique’ for assigning to all repeated elements of X the same index
     (*note ‘unique’: XREFunique.).

          X = [91, 92, 90, 92, 90, 89, 91, 89, 90, 100, 100, 100];
          [U, ~, J] = unique (X);
          [accumarray(J', 1), U']
            ⇒  2    89
                3    90
                2    91
                2    92
                3   100

     Another example, where the result is a multi-dimensional 3-D array
     and the default value (zero) appears in the output:

          accumarray ([1, 1, 1;
                       2, 1, 2;
                       2, 3, 2;
                       2, 1, 2;
                       2, 3, 2], 101:105)
          ⇒ ans(:,:,1) = [101, 0, 0; 0, 0, 0]
          ⇒ ans(:,:,2) = [0, 0, 0; 206, 0, 208]

     The sparse option can be used as an alternative to the ‘sparse’
     constructor (*note ‘sparse’: XREFsparse.).  Thus

          sparse (I, J, SV)

     can be written with ‘accumarray’ as

          accumarray ([I, J], SV', [], [], 0, true)

     For repeated indices, ‘sparse’ adds the corresponding value.  To
     take the minimum instead, use ‘min’ as an accumulator function:

          accumarray ([I, J], SV', [], @min, 0, true)

     The complexity of accumarray in general for the non-sparse case is
     generally O(M+N), where N is the number of subscripts and M is the
     maximum subscript (linearized in multi-dimensional case).  If FUNC
     is one of ‘@sum’ (default), ‘@max’, ‘@min’ or ‘@(x) {x}’, an
     optimized code path is used.  Note that for general reduction
     function the interpreter overhead can play a major part and it may
     be more efficient to do multiple accumarray calls and compute the
     results in a vectorized manner.

     See also: *note accumdim: XREFaccumdim, *note unique: XREFunique,
     *note sparse: XREFsparse.

 -- : accumdim (SUBS, VALS, DIM, N, FUNC, FILLVAL)
     Create an array by accumulating the slices of an array into the
     positions defined by their subscripts along a specified dimension.

     The subscripts are defined by the index vector SUBS.  The dimension
     is specified by DIM.  If not given, it defaults to the first
     non-singleton dimension.  The length of SUBS must be equal to ‘size
     (VALS, DIM)’.

     The extent of the result matrix in the working dimension will be
     determined by the subscripts themselves.  However, if N is defined
     it determines this extent.

     The default action of ‘accumdim’ is to sum the subarrays with the
     same subscripts.  This behavior can be modified by defining the
     FUNC function.  This should be a function or function handle that
     accepts an array and a dimension, and reduces the array along this
     dimension.  As a special exception, the built-in ‘min’ and ‘max’
     functions can be used directly, and ‘accumdim’ accounts for the
     middle empty argument that is used in their calling.

     The slices of the returned array that have no subscripts associated
     with them are set to zero.  Defining FILLVAL to some other value
     allows these values to be defined.

     An example of the use of ‘accumdim’ is:

          accumdim ([1, 2, 1, 2, 1], [ 7, -10,   4;
                                      -5, -12,   8;
                                     -12,   2,   8;
                                     -10,   9,  -3;
                                      -5,  -3, -13])
          ⇒ [-10,-11,-1;-15,-3,5]

19.5 Miscellaneous Techniques
=============================

Here are some other ways of improving the execution speed of Octave
programs.

   • Avoid computing costly intermediate results multiple times.  Octave
     currently does not eliminate common subexpressions.  Also, certain
     internal computation results are cached for variables.  For
     instance, if a matrix variable is used multiple times as an index,
     checking the indices (and internal conversion to integers) is only
     done once.

   • Be aware of lazy copies (copy-on-write).  When a copy of an object
     is created, the data is not immediately copied, but rather shared.
     The actual copying is postponed until the copied data needs to be
     modified.  For example:

          a = zeros (1000); # create a 1000x1000 matrix
          b = a; # no copying done here
          b(1) = 1; # copying done here

     Lazy copying applies to whole Octave objects such as matrices,
     cells, struct, and also individual cell or struct elements (not
     array elements).

     Additionally, index expressions also use lazy copying when Octave
     can determine that the indexed portion is contiguous in memory.
     For example:

          a = zeros (1000); # create a 1000x1000 matrix
          b = a(:,10:100);  # no copying done here
          b = a(10:100,:);  # copying done here

     This applies to arrays (matrices), cell arrays, and structs indexed
     using ‘()’.  Index expressions generating comma-separated lists can
     also benefit from shallow copying in some cases.  In particular,
     when A is a struct array, expressions like ‘{a.x}, {a(:,2).x}’ will
     use lazy copying, so that data can be shared between a struct array
     and a cell array.

     Most indexing expressions do not live longer than their parent
     objects.  In rare cases, however, a lazily copied slice outlasts
     its parent, in which case it becomes orphaned, still occupying
     unnecessarily more memory than needed.  To provide a remedy working
     in most real cases, Octave checks for orphaned lazy slices at
     certain situations, when a value is stored into a "permanent"
     location, such as a named variable or cell or struct element, and
     possibly economizes them.  For example:

          a = zeros (1000); # create a 1000x1000 matrix
          b = a(:,10:100);  # lazy slice
          a = []; # the original "a" array is still allocated
          c{1} = b; # b is reallocated at this point

   • Avoid deep recursion.  Function calls to m-file functions carry a
     relatively significant overhead, so rewriting a recursion as a loop
     often helps.  Also, note that the maximum level of recursion is
     limited.

   • Avoid resizing matrices unnecessarily.  When building a single
     result matrix from a series of calculations, set the size of the
     result matrix first, then insert values into it.  Write

          result = zeros (big_n, big_m)
          for i = over:and_over
            ridx = ...
            cidx = ...
            result(ridx, cidx) = new_value ();
          endfor

     instead of

          result = [];
          for i = ever:and_ever
            result = [ result, new_value() ];
          endfor

     Sometimes the number of items can not be computed in advance, and
     stack-like operations are needed.  When elements are being
     repeatedly inserted or removed from the end of an array, Octave
     detects it as stack usage and attempts to use a smarter memory
     management strategy by pre-allocating the array in bigger chunks.
     This strategy is also applied to cell and struct arrays.

          a = [];
          while (condition)
            ...
            a(end+1) = value; # "push" operation
            ...
            a(end) = []; # "pop" operation
            ...
          endwhile

   • Avoid calling ‘eval’ or ‘feval’ excessively.  Parsing input or
     looking up the name of a function in the symbol table are
     relatively expensive operations.

     If you are using ‘eval’ merely as an exception handling mechanism,
     and not because you need to execute some arbitrary text, use the
     ‘try’ statement instead.  *Note The try Statement::.

   • Use ‘ignore_function_time_stamp’ when appropriate.  If you are
     calling lots of functions, and none of them will need to change
     during your run, set the variable ‘ignore_function_time_stamp’ to
     "all".  This will stop Octave from checking the time stamp of a
     function file to see if it has been updated while the program is
     being run.

19.6 Examples
=============

The following are examples of vectorization questions asked by actual
users of Octave and their solutions.

   • For a vector ‘A’, the following loop

          n = length (A) - 1;
          B = zeros (n, 2);
          for i = 1:n
            ## this will be two columns, the first is the difference and
            ## the second the mean of the two elements used for the diff.
            B(i,:) = [A(i+1)-A(i), (A(i+1) + A(i))/2];
          endfor

     can be turned into the following one-liner:

          B = [diff(A)(:), 0.5*(A(1:end-1)+A(2:end))(:)]

     Note the usage of colon indexing to flatten an intermediate result
     into a column vector.  This is a common vectorization trick.

File: octave.info,  Node: Solvers,  Next: Minimizers,  Up: Nonlinear Equations

20.1 Solvers
============

Octave can solve sets of nonlinear equations of the form

     F (x) = 0

using the function ‘fsolve’, which is based on the MINPACK subroutine
‘hybrd’.  This is an iterative technique so a starting point must be
provided.  This also has the consequence that convergence is not
guaranteed even if a solution exists.

 -- : fsolve (FCN, X0)
 -- : fsolve (FCN, X0, OPTIONS)
 -- : [X, FVAL, INFO, OUTPUT, FJAC] = fsolve (...)
     Solve a system of nonlinear equations defined by the function FCN.

     FUN is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function to evaluate.  FCN should accept a vector
     (array) defining the unknown variables, and return a vector of
     left-hand sides of the equations.  Right-hand sides are defined to
     be zeros.  In other words, this function attempts to determine a
     vector X such that ‘FCN (X)’ gives (approximately) all zeros.

     X0 is an initial guess for the solution.  The shape of X0 is
     preserved in all calls to FCN, but otherwise is treated as a column
     vector.

     OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional parameters which
     control the algorithm.  Currently, ‘fsolve’ recognizes these
     options: "AutoScaling", "ComplexEqn", "FinDiffType", "FunValCheck",
     "Jacobian", "MaxFunEvals", "MaxIter", "OutputFcn", "TolFun",
     "TolX", "TypicalX", and "Updating".

     If "AutoScaling" is "on", the variables will be automatically
     scaled according to the column norms of the (estimated) Jacobian.
     As a result, "TolFun" becomes scaling-independent.  By default,
     this option is "off" because it may sometimes deliver unexpected
     (though mathematically correct) results.

     If "ComplexEqn" is "on", ‘fsolve’ will attempt to solve complex
     equations in complex variables, assuming that the equations possess
     a complex derivative (i.e., are holomorphic).  If this is not what
     you want, you should unpack the real and imaginary parts of the
     system to get a real system.

     If "Jacobian" is "on", it specifies that FCN—when called with 2
     output arguments—also returns the Jacobian matrix of right-hand
     sides at the requested point.

     "MaxFunEvals" proscribes the maximum number of function evaluations
     before optimization is halted.  The default value is ‘100 *
     number_of_variables’, i.e., ‘100 * length (X0)’.  The value must be
     a positive integer.

     If "Updating" is "on", the function will attempt to use Broyden
     updates to update the Jacobian, in order to reduce the number of
     Jacobian calculations.  If your user function always calculates the
     Jacobian (regardless of number of output arguments) then this
     option provides no advantage and should be disabled.

     "TolX" specifies the termination tolerance in the unknown
     variables, while "TolFun" is a tolerance for equations.  Default is
     ‘1e-6’ for both "TolX" and "TolFun".

     For a description of the other options, *note ‘optimset’:
     XREFoptimset.  To initialize an options structure with default
     values for ‘fsolve’ use ‘options = optimset ("fsolve")’.

     The first output X is the solution while the second output FVAL
     contains the value of the function FCN evaluated at X (ideally a
     vector of all zeros).

     The third output INFO reports whether the algorithm succeeded and
     may take one of the following values:

     1
          Converged to a solution point.  Relative residual error is
          less than specified by ‘TolFun’.

     2
          Last relative step size was less than ‘TolX’.

     3
          Last relative decrease in residual was less than ‘TolFun’.

     0
          Iteration limit (either ‘MaxIter’ or ‘MaxFunEvals’) exceeded.

     -1
          Stopped by ‘OutputFcn’.

     -2
          The Jacobian became excessively small and the search stalled.

     -3
          The trust region radius became excessively small.

     OUTPUT is a structure containing runtime information about the
     ‘fsolve’ algorithm.  Fields in the structure are:

     ‘iterations’
          Number of iterations through loop.

     ‘successful’
          Number of successful iterations.

     ‘funcCount’
          Number of function evaluations.

     The final output FJAC contains the value of the Jacobian evaluated
     at X.

     Note: If you only have a single nonlinear equation of one variable,
     using ‘fzero’ is usually a much better idea.

     Note about user-supplied Jacobians: As an inherent property of the
     algorithm, a Jacobian is always requested for a solution vector
     whose residual vector is already known, and it is the last accepted
     successful step.  Often this will be one of the last two calls, but
     not always.  If the savings by reusing intermediate results from
     residual calculation in Jacobian calculation are significant, the
     best strategy is to employ ‘OutputFcn’: After a vector is evaluated
     for residuals, if ‘OutputFcn’ is called with that vector, then the
     intermediate results should be saved for future Jacobian
     evaluation, and should be kept until a Jacobian evaluation is
     requested or until ‘OutputFcn’ is called with a different vector,
     in which case they should be dropped in favor of this most recent
     vector.  A short example how this can be achieved follows:

          function [fval, fjac] = user_func (x, optimvalues, state)
          persistent sav = [], sav0 = [];
          if (nargin == 1)
            ## evaluation call
            if (nargout == 1)
              sav0.x = x; # mark saved vector
              ## calculate fval, save results to sav0.
            elseif (nargout == 2)
              ## calculate fjac using sav.
            endif
          else
            ## outputfcn call.
            if (all (x == sav0.x))
              sav = sav0;
            endif
            ## maybe output iteration status, etc.
          endif
          endfunction

          ## ...

          fsolve (@user_func, x0, optimset ("OutputFcn", @user_func, ...))

     See also: *note fzero: XREFfzero, *note optimset: XREFoptimset.

   The following is a complete example.  To solve the set of equations

     -2x^2 + 3xy   + 4 sin(y) = 6
      3x^2 - 2xy^2 + 3 cos(x) = -4

you first need to write a function to compute the value of the given
function.  For example:

     function y = f (x)
       y = zeros (2, 1);
       y(1) = -2*x(1)^2 + 3*x(1)*x(2)   + 4*sin(x(2)) - 6;
       y(2) =  3*x(1)^2 - 2*x(1)*x(2)^2 + 3*cos(x(1)) + 4;
     endfunction

   Then, call ‘fsolve’ with a specified initial condition to find the
roots of the system of equations.  For example, given the function ‘f’
defined above,

     [x, fval, info] = fsolve (@f, [1; 2])

results in the solution

     x =

       0.57983
       2.54621

     fval =

       -5.7184e-10
        5.5460e-10

     info = 1

A value of ‘info = 1’ indicates that the solution has converged.

   When no Jacobian is supplied (as in the example above) it is
approximated numerically.  This requires more function evaluations, and
hence is less efficient.  In the example above we could compute the
Jacobian analytically as

     function [y, jac] = f (x)
       y = zeros (2, 1);
       y(1) = -2*x(1)^2 + 3*x(1)*x(2)   + 4*sin(x(2)) - 6;
       y(2) =  3*x(1)^2 - 2*x(1)*x(2)^2 + 3*cos(x(1)) + 4;
       if (nargout == 2)
         jac = zeros (2, 2);
         jac(1,1) =  3*x(2) - 4*x(1);
         jac(1,2) =  4*cos(x(2)) + 3*x(1);
         jac(2,1) = -2*x(2)^2 - 3*sin(x(1)) + 6*x(1);
         jac(2,2) = -4*x(1)*x(2);
       endif
     endfunction

The Jacobian can then be used with the following call to ‘fsolve’:

     [x, fval, info] = fsolve (@f, [1; 2], optimset ("jacobian", "on"));

which gives the same solution as before.

 -- : fzero (FUN, X0)
 -- : fzero (FUN, X0, OPTIONS)
 -- : [X, FVAL, INFO, OUTPUT] = fzero (...)
     Find a zero of a univariate function.

     FUN is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function to evaluate.

     X0 should be a two-element vector specifying two points which
     bracket a zero.  In other words, there must be a change in sign of
     the function between X0(1) and X0(2).  More mathematically, the
     following must hold

          sign (FUN(X0(1))) * sign (FUN(X0(2))) <= 0

     If X0 is a single scalar then several nearby and distant values are
     probed in an attempt to obtain a valid bracketing.  If this is not
     successful, the function fails.

     OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional options.  Currently,
     ‘fzero’ recognizes these options: "Display", "FunValCheck",
     "MaxFunEvals", "MaxIter", "OutputFcn", and "TolX".

     "MaxFunEvals" proscribes the maximum number of function evaluations
     before the search is halted.  The default value is ‘Inf’.  The
     value must be a positive integer.

     "MaxIter" proscribes the maximum number of algorithm iterations
     before the search is halted.  The default value is ‘Inf’.  The
     value must be a positive integer.

     "TolX" specifies the termination tolerance for the solution X.  The
     default value is ‘eps’.

     For a description of the other options, *note ‘optimset’:
     XREFoptimset.  To initialize an options structure with default
     values for ‘fzero’ use ‘options = optimset ("fzero")’.

     On exit, the function returns X, the approximate zero point, and
     FVAL, the function evaluated at X.

     The third output INFO reports whether the algorithm succeeded and
     may take one of the following values:

        • 1 The algorithm converged to a solution.

        • 0 Maximum number of iterations or function evaluations has
          been reached.

        • -1 The algorithm has been terminated by a user ‘OutputFcn’.

        • -5 The algorithm may have converged to a singular point.

     OUTPUT is a structure containing runtime information about the
     ‘fzero’ algorithm.  Fields in the structure are:

        • iterations Number of iterations through loop.

        • funcCount Number of function evaluations.

        • algorithm The string "bisection, interpolation".

        • bracketx A two-element vector with the final bracketing of the

20.2 Minimizers
===============

Often it is useful to find the minimum value of a function rather than
just the zeroes where it crosses the x-axis.  ‘fminbnd’ is designed for
the simpler, but very common, case of a univariate function where the
interval to search is bounded.  For unbounded minimization of a function
with potentially many variables use ‘fminunc’ or ‘fminsearch’.  The two
functions use different internal algorithms and some knowledge of the
objective function is required.  For functions which can be
differentiated, ‘fminunc’ is appropriate.  For functions with
discontinuities, or for which a gradient search would fail, use
‘fminsearch’.  *Note Optimization::, for minimization with the presence
of constraint functions.  Note that searches can be made for maxima by
simply inverting the objective function (‘Fto_max = -Fto_min’).

 -- : X = fminbnd (FUN, A, B)
 -- : X = fminbnd (FUN, A, B, OPTIONS)
 -- : [X, FVAL, INFO, OUTPUT] = fminbnd (...)
     Find a minimum point of a univariate function.

     FUN is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function to evaluate.

     The starting interval is specified by A (left boundary) and B
     (right boundary).  The endpoints must be finite.

     OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional parameters which
     control the algorithm.  Currently, ‘fminbnd’ recognizes these
     options: "Display", "FunValCheck", "MaxFunEvals", "MaxIter",
     "OutputFcn", "TolX".

     "MaxFunEvals" proscribes the maximum number of function evaluations
     before optimization is halted.  The default value is 500.  The
     value must be a positive integer.

     "MaxIter" proscribes the maximum number of algorithm iterations
     before optimization is halted.  The default value is 500.  The
     value must be a positive integer.

     "TolX" specifies the termination tolerance for the solution X.  The
     default is ‘1e-4’.

     For a description of the other options, *note ‘optimset’:
     XREFoptimset.  To initialize an options structure with default
     values for ‘fminbnd’ use ‘options = optimset ("fminbnd")’.

     On exit, the function returns X, the approximate minimum point, and
     FVAL, the function evaluated X.

     The third output INFO reports whether the algorithm succeeded and
     may take one of the following values:

        • 1 The algorithm converged to a solution.

        • 0 Iteration limit (either ‘MaxIter’ or ‘MaxFunEvals’)
          exceeded.

        • -1 The algorithm was terminated by a user ‘OutputFcn’.

     Programming Notes: The search for a minimum is restricted to be in
     the finite interval bound by A and B.  If you have only one initial
     point to begin searching from then you will need to use an
     unconstrained minimization algorithm such as ‘fminunc’ or
     ‘fminsearch’.  ‘fminbnd’ internally uses a Golden Section search
     strategy.

     See also: *note fzero: XREFfzero, *note fminunc: XREFfminunc, *note
     fminsearch: XREFfminsearch, *note optimset: XREFoptimset.

 -- : fminunc (FCN, X0)
 -- : fminunc (FCN, X0, OPTIONS)
 -- : [X, FVAL, INFO, OUTPUT, GRAD, HESS] = fminunc (FCN, ...)
     Solve an unconstrained optimization problem defined by the function
     FCN.

     ‘fminunc’ attempts to determine a vector X such that ‘FCN (X)’ is a
     local minimum.

     FUN is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function to evaluate.  FCN should accept a vector
     (array) defining the unknown variables, and return the objective
     function value, optionally with gradient.

     X0 determines a starting guess.  The shape of X0 is preserved in
     all calls to FCN, but otherwise is treated as a column vector.

     OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional parameters which
     control the algorithm.  Currently, ‘fminunc’ recognizes these
     options: "AutoScaling", "FinDiffType", "FunValCheck", "GradObj",
     "MaxFunEvals", "MaxIter", "OutputFcn", "TolFun", "TolX",
     "TypicalX".

     If "AutoScaling" is "on", the variables will be automatically
     scaled according to the column norms of the (estimated) Jacobian.
     As a result, "TolFun" becomes scaling-independent.  By default,
     this option is "off" because it may sometimes deliver unexpected
     (though mathematically correct) results.

     If "GradObj" is "on", it specifies that FCN—when called with two
     output arguments—also returns the Jacobian matrix of partial first
     derivatives at the requested point.

     "MaxFunEvals" proscribes the maximum number of function evaluations
     before optimization is halted.  The default value is ‘100 *
     number_of_variables’, i.e., ‘100 * length (X0)’.  The value must be
     a positive integer.

     "MaxIter" proscribes the maximum number of algorithm iterations
     before optimization is halted.  The default value is 400.  The
     value must be a positive integer.

     "TolX" specifies the termination tolerance for the unknown
     variables X, while "TolFun" is a tolerance for the objective
     function value FVAL.  The default is ‘1e-6’ for both options.

     For a description of the other options, *note ‘optimset’:
     XREFoptimset.

     On return, X is the location of the minimum and FVAL contains the
     value of the objective function at X.

     INFO may be one of the following values:

     1
          Converged to a solution point.  Relative gradient error is
          less than specified by ‘TolFun’.

     2
          Last relative step size was less than ‘TolX’.

     3
          Last relative change in function value was less than ‘TolFun’.

     0
          Iteration limit exceeded—either maximum number of algorithm
          iterations ‘MaxIter’ or maximum number of function evaluations
          ‘MaxFunEvals’.

     -1
          Algorithm terminated by ‘OutputFcn’.

     -3
          The trust region radius became excessively small.

     Optionally, ‘fminunc’ can return a structure with convergence
     statistics (OUTPUT), the output gradient (GRAD) at the solution X,
     and approximate Hessian (HESS) at the solution X.

     Application Notes: If the objective function is a single nonlinear
     equation of one variable then using ‘fminbnd’ is usually a better
     choice.

     The algorithm used by ‘fminunc’ is a gradient search which depends
     on the objective function being differentiable.  If the function
     has discontinuities it may be better to use a derivative-free
     algorithm such as ‘fminsearch’.

     See also: *note fminbnd: XREFfminbnd, *note fminsearch:
     XREFfminsearch, *note optimset: XREFoptimset.

 -- : X = fminsearch (FUN, X0)
 -- : X = fminsearch (FUN, X0, OPTIONS)
 -- : X = fminsearch (PROBLEM)
 -- : [X, FVAL, EXITFLAG, OUTPUT] = fminsearch (...)

     Find a value of X which minimizes the multi-variable function FUN.

     FUN is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function to evaluate.

     The search begins at the point X0 and iterates using the Nelder &
     Mead Simplex algorithm (a derivative-free method).  This algorithm
     is better-suited to functions which have discontinuities or for
     which a gradient-based search such as ‘fminunc’ fails.

     Options for the search are provided in the parameter OPTIONS using
     the function ‘optimset’.  Currently, ‘fminsearch’ accepts the
     options: "Display", "FunValCheck","MaxFunEvals", "MaxIter",
     "OutputFcn", "TolFun", "TolX".

     "MaxFunEvals" proscribes the maximum number of function evaluations
     before optimization is halted.  The default value is ‘200 *
     number_of_variables’, i.e., ‘200 * length (X0)’.  The value must be
     a positive integer.

     "MaxIter" proscribes the maximum number of algorithm iterations
     before optimization is halted.  The default value is ‘200 *
     number_of_variables’, i.e., ‘200 * length (X0)’.  The value must be
     a positive integer.

     For a description of the other options, *note ‘optimset’:
     XREFoptimset.  To initialize an options structure with default
     values for ‘fminsearch’ use ‘options = optimset ("fminsearch")’.

     ‘fminsearch’ may also be called with a single structure argument
     with the following fields:

     ‘objective’
          The objective function.

     ‘x0’
          The initial point.

     ‘solver’
          Must be set to "fminsearch".

     ‘options’
          A structure returned from ‘optimset’ or an empty matrix to
          indicate that defaults should be used.

     The field ‘options’ is optional.  All others are required.

     On exit, the function returns X, the minimum point, and FVAL, the
     function value at the minimum.

     The third output EXITFLAG reports whether the algorithm succeeded
     and may take one of the following values:

     1
          if the algorithm converged (size of the simplex is smaller
          than ‘TolX’ *AND* the step in function value between
          iterations is smaller than ‘TolFun’).

     0
          if the maximum number of iterations or the maximum number of
          function evaluations are exceeded.

     -1
          if the iteration is stopped by the "OutputFcn".

     The fourth output is a structure OUTPUT containing runtime about
     the algorithm.  Fields in the structure are ‘funcCount’ containing
     the number of function calls to FUN, ‘iterations’ containing the
     number of iteration steps, ‘algorithm’ with the name of the search
     algorithm (always: "Nelder-Mead simplex direct search"), and
     ‘message’ with the exit message.

     Example:

          fminsearch (@(x) (x(1)-5).^2+(x(2)-8).^4, [0;0])

     Note: If you need to find the minimum of a single variable function
     it is probably better to use ‘fminbnd’.

     See also: *note fminbnd: XREFfminbnd, *note fminunc: XREFfminunc,
     *note optimset: XREFoptimset.

   The function ‘humps’ is a useful function for testing zero and
extrema finding functions.

 -- : Y = humps (X)
 -- : [X, Y] = humps (X)
     Evaluate a function with multiple minima, maxima, and zero
     crossings.

     The output Y is the evaluation of the rational function:

                  1200*X^4 - 2880*X^3 + 2036*X^2 - 348*X - 88
           Y = - ---------------------------------------------
                   200*X^4 - 480*X^3 + 406*X^2 - 138*X + 17

     X may be a scalar, vector or array.  If X is omitted, the default
     range [0:0.05:1] is used.

     When called with two output arguments, [X, Y], X will contain the
     input values, and Y will contain the output from ‘humps’.

     Programming Notes: ‘humps’ has two local maxima located near X =
     0.300 and 0.893, a local minimum near X = 0.637, and zeros near X =
     -0.132 and 1.300.  ‘humps’ is a useful function for testing
     algorithms which find zeros or local minima and maxima.

     Try ‘demo humps’ to see a plot of the ‘humps’ function.

21.1 Creating and Manipulating Diagonal/Permutation Matrices
============================================================

A diagonal matrix is defined as a matrix that has zero entries outside
the main diagonal; that is, ‘D(i,j) == 0’ if ‘i != j’.  Most often,
square diagonal matrices are considered; however, the definition can
equally be applied to non-square matrices, in which case we usually
speak of a rectangular diagonal matrix.

   A permutation matrix is defined as a square matrix that has a single
element equal to unity in each row and each column; all other elements
are zero.  That is, there exists a permutation (vector) ‘p’ such that
‘P(i,j) == 1’ if ‘j == p(i)’ and ‘P(i,j) == 0’ otherwise.

   Octave provides special treatment of real and complex rectangular
diagonal matrices, as well as permutation matrices.  They are stored as
special objects, using efficient storage and algorithms, facilitating
writing both readable and efficient matrix algebra expressions in the
Octave language.  The special treatment may be disabled by using the
functions “optimize_diagonal_matrix” and “optimize_permutation_matrix”.

 -- : VAL = optimize_diagonal_matrix ()
 -- : OLD_VAL = optimize_diagonal_matrix (NEW_VAL)
 -- : optimize_diagonal_matrix (NEW_VAL, "local")
     Query or set whether a special space-efficient format is used for
     storing diagonal matrices.

     The default value is true.  If this option is set to false, Octave
     will store diagonal matrices as full matrices.

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the
     setting is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it
     calls.  The original setting is restored when exiting the function.

     See also: *note optimize_range: XREFoptimize_range, *note
     optimize_permutation_matrix: XREFoptimize_permutation_matrix.

 -- : VAL = optimize_permutation_matrix ()
 -- : OLD_VAL = optimize_permutation_matrix (NEW_VAL)
 -- : optimize_permutation_matrix (NEW_VAL, "local")
     Query or set whether a special space-efficient format is used for
     storing permutation matrices.

     The default value is true.  If this option is set to false, Octave
     will store permutation matrices as full matrices.

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the
     setting is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it
     calls.  The original setting is restored when exiting the function.

     See also: *note optimize_range: XREFoptimize_range, *note
     optimize_diagonal_matrix: XREFoptimize_diagonal_matrix.

   The space savings are significant as demonstrated by the following
code.

     x = diag (rand (10, 1));
     xf = full (x);
     sizeof (x)
     ⇒ 80
     sizeof (xf)
     ⇒ 800

21.1.1 Creating Diagonal Matrices
---------------------------------

The most common and easiest way to create a diagonal matrix is using the
built-in function “diag”.  The expression ‘diag (v)’, with V a vector,
will create a square diagonal matrix with elements on the main diagonal
given by the elements of V, and size equal to the length of V.  ‘diag
(v, m, n)’ can be used to construct a rectangular diagonal matrix.  The
result of these expressions will be a special diagonal matrix object,
rather than a general matrix object.

   Diagonal matrix with unit elements can be created using “eye”.  Some
other built-in functions can also return diagonal matrices.  Examples
include “balance” or “inv”.

   Example:

       diag (1:4)
     ⇒
     Diagonal Matrix

        1   0   0   0
        0   2   0   0
        0   0   3   0
        0   0   0   4

       diag (1:3,5,3)

     ⇒
     Diagonal Matrix

        1   0   0
        0   2   0
        0   0   3
        0   0   0
        0   0   0

21.1.2 Creating Permutation Matrices
------------------------------------

For creating permutation matrices, Octave does not introduce a new
function, but rather overrides an existing syntax: permutation matrices
can be conveniently created by indexing an identity matrix by
permutation vectors.  That is, if Q is a permutation vector of length N,
the expression

       P = eye (n) (:, q);

will create a permutation matrix - a special matrix object.

     eye (n) (q, :)

will also work (and create a row permutation matrix), as well as

     eye (n) (q1, q2).

   For example:

       eye (4) ([1,3,2,4],:)
     ⇒
     Permutation Matrix

        1   0   0   0
        0   0   1   0
        0   1   0   0
        0   0   0   1

       eye (4) (:,[1,3,2,4])
     ⇒
     Permutation Matrix

        1   0   0   0
        0   0   1   0
        0   1   0   0
        0   0   0   1

   Mathematically, an identity matrix is both diagonal and permutation
matrix.  In Octave, ‘eye (n)’ returns a diagonal matrix, because a
matrix can only have one class.  You can convert this diagonal matrix to
a permutation matrix by indexing it by an identity permutation, as shown
below.  This is a special property of the identity matrix; indexing
other diagonal matrices generally produces a full matrix.

       eye (3)
     ⇒
     Diagonal Matrix

        1   0   0
        0   1   0
        0   0   1

       eye(3)(1:3,:)
     ⇒
     Permutation Matrix

        1   0   0
        0   1   0
        0   0   1

   Some other built-in functions can also return permutation matrices.
Examples include “inv” or “lu”.

21.1.3 Explicit and Implicit Conversions
----------------------------------------

The diagonal and permutation matrices are special objects in their own
right.  A number of operations and built-in functions are defined for
these matrices to use special, more efficient code than would be used
for a full matrix in the same place.  Examples are given in further
sections.

   To facilitate smooth mixing with full matrices, backward
compatibility, and compatibility with MATLAB, the diagonal and
permutation matrices should allow any operation that works on full
matrices, and will either treat it specially, or implicitly convert
themselves to full matrices.

   Instances include matrix indexing, except for extracting a single
element or a leading submatrix, indexed assignment, or applying most
mapper functions, such as “exp”.

   An explicit conversion to a full matrix can be requested using the
built-in function “full”.  It should also be noted that the diagonal and
permutation matrix objects will cache the result of the conversion after
it is first requested (explicitly or implicitly), so that subsequent
conversions will be very cheap.

21.2 Linear Algebra with Diagonal/Permutation Matrices
======================================================

As has been already said, diagonal and permutation matrices make it
possible to use efficient algorithms while preserving natural linear
algebra syntax.  This section describes in detail the operations that
are treated specially when performed on these special matrix objects.

* Expressions Involving Diagonal Matrices::

File: octave.info,  Node: Expressions Involving Diagonal Matrices,  Next: Expressions Involving Permutation Matrices,  Up: Matrix Algebra

21.2.1 Expressions Involving Diagonal Matrices
----------------------------------------------

Assume D is a diagonal matrix.  If M is a full matrix, then ‘D*M’ will
scale the rows of M.  That means, if ‘S = D*M’, then for each pair of
indices i,j it holds

     S(i,j) = D(i,i) * M(i,j).

   Similarly, ‘M*D’ will do a column scaling.

   The matrix D may also be rectangular, m-by-n where ‘m != n’.  If ‘m <
n’, then the expression ‘D*M’ is equivalent to

     D(:,1:m) * M(1:m,:),

i.e., trailing ‘n-m’ rows of M are ignored.  If ‘m > n’, then ‘D*M’ is
equivalent to

     [D(1:n,:) * M; zeros(m-n, columns (M))],

i.e., null rows are appended to the result.  The situation for
right-multiplication ‘M*D’ is analogous.

   The expressions ‘D \ M’ and ‘M / D’ perform inverse scaling.  They
are equivalent to solving a diagonal (or rectangular diagonal) in a
least-squares minimum-norm sense.  In exact arithmetic, this is
equivalent to multiplying by a pseudoinverse.  The pseudoinverse of a
rectangular diagonal matrix is again a rectangular diagonal matrix with
swapped dimensions, where each nonzero diagonal element is replaced by
its reciprocal.  The matrix division algorithms do, in fact, use
division rather than multiplication by reciprocals for better numerical
accuracy; otherwise, they honor the above definition.  Note that a
diagonal matrix is never truncated due to ill-conditioning; otherwise,
it would not be of much use for scaling.  This is typically consistent
with linear algebra needs.  A full matrix that only happens to be
diagonal (and is thus not a special object) is of course treated
normally.

   Multiplication and division by diagonal matrices work efficiently
also when combined with sparse matrices, i.e., ‘D*S’, where D is a
diagonal matrix and S is a sparse matrix scales the rows of the sparse
matrix and returns a sparse matrix.  The expressions ‘S*D’, ‘D\S’, ‘S/D’
work analogically.

   If D1 and D2 are both diagonal matrices, then the expressions

     D1 + D2
     D1 - D2
     D1 * D2
     D1 / D2
     D1 \ D2

again produce diagonal matrices, provided that normal dimension matching
rules are obeyed.  The relations used are same as described above.

   Also, a diagonal matrix D can be multiplied or divided by a scalar,
or raised to a scalar power if it is square, producing diagonal matrix
result in all cases.

   A diagonal matrix can also be transposed or conjugate-transposed,
giving the expected result.  Extracting a leading submatrix of a
diagonal matrix, i.e., ‘D(1:m,1:n)’, will produce a diagonal matrix,
other indexing expressions will implicitly convert to full matrix.

   Adding a diagonal matrix to a full matrix only operates on the
diagonal elements.  Thus,

     A = A + eps * eye (n)

is an efficient method of augmenting the diagonal of a matrix.
Subtraction works analogically.

   When involved in expressions with other element-by-element operators,
‘.*’, ‘./’, ‘.\’ or ‘.^’, an implicit conversion to full matrix will
take place.  This is not always strictly necessary but chosen to
facilitate better consistency with MATLAB.

21.2.2 Expressions Involving Permutation Matrices
-------------------------------------------------

If P is a permutation matrix and M a matrix, the expression ‘P*M’ will
permute the rows of M.  Similarly, ‘M*P’ will yield a column
permutation.  Matrix division ‘P\M’ and ‘M/P’ can be used to do inverse
permutation.

   The previously described syntax for creating permutation matrices can
actually help an user to understand the connection between a permutation
matrix and a permuting vector.  Namely, the following holds, where ‘I =
eye (n)’ is an identity matrix:

       I(p,:) * M = (I*M) (p,:) = M(p,:)

   Similarly,

       M * I(:,p) = (M*I) (:,p) = M(:,p)

   The expressions ‘I(p,:)’ and ‘I(:,p)’ are permutation matrices.

   A permutation matrix can be transposed (or conjugate-transposed,
which is the same, because a permutation matrix is never complex),
inverting the permutation, or equivalently, turning a row-permutation
matrix into a column-permutation one.  For permutation matrices,
transpose is equivalent to inversion, thus ‘P\M’ is equivalent to
‘P'*M’.  Transpose of a permutation matrix (or inverse) is a
constant-time operation, flipping only a flag internally, and thus the
choice between the two above equivalent expressions for inverse
permuting is completely up to the user’s taste.

   Multiplication and division by permutation matrices works efficiently
also when combined with sparse matrices, i.e., ‘P*S’, where P is a
permutation matrix and S is a sparse matrix permutes the rows of the
sparse matrix and returns a sparse matrix.  The expressions ‘S*P’,
‘P\S’, ‘S/P’ work analogically.

   Two permutation matrices can be multiplied or divided (if their sizes
match), performing a composition of permutations.  Also a permutation
matrix can be indexed by a permutation vector (or two vectors), giving
again a permutation matrix.  Any other operations do not generally yield
a permutation matrix and will thus trigger the implicit conversion.

21.3 Functions That Are Aware of These Matrices
===============================================

This section lists the built-in functions that are aware of diagonal and
permutation matrices on input, or can return them as output.  Passed to
other functions, these matrices will in general trigger an implicit
conversion.  (Of course, user-defined dynamically linked functions may
also work with diagonal or permutation matrices).

21.3.1 Diagonal Matrix Functions
--------------------------------

“inv” and “pinv” can be applied to a diagonal matrix, yielding again a
diagonal matrix.  “det” will use an efficient straightforward
calculation when given a diagonal matrix, as well as “cond”.  The
following mapper functions can be applied to a diagonal matrix without
converting it to a full one: “abs”, “real”, “imag”, “conj”, “sqrt”.  A
diagonal matrix can also be returned from the “balance” and “svd”
functions.  The “sparse” function will convert a diagonal matrix
efficiently to a sparse matrix.

21.3.2 Permutation Matrix Functions
-----------------------------------

“inv” and “pinv” will invert a permutation matrix, preserving its
specialness.  “det” can be applied to a permutation matrix, efficiently
calculating the sign of the permutation (which is equal to the
determinant).

   A permutation matrix can also be returned from the built-in functions
“lu” and “qr”, if a pivoted factorization is requested.

   The “sparse” function will convert a permutation matrix efficiently
to a sparse matrix.  The “find” function will also work efficiently with
a permutation matrix, making it possible to conveniently obtain the
permutation indices.

21.4 Examples of Usage
======================

The following can be used to solve a linear system ‘A*x = b’ using the
pivoted LU factorization:

       [L, U, P] = lu (A); ## now L*U = P*A
       x = U \ (L \ P) * b;

This is one way to normalize columns of a matrix X to unit norm:

       s = norm (X, "columns");
       X /= diag (s);

The same can also be accomplished with broadcasting (*note
Broadcasting::):

       s = norm (X, "columns");
       X ./= s;

The following expression is a way to efficiently calculate the sign of a
permutation, given by a permutation vector P.  It will also work in
earlier versions of Octave, but slowly.

       det (eye (length (p))(p, :))

Finally, here’s how to solve a linear system ‘A*x = b’ with Tikhonov
regularization (ridge regression) using SVD (a skeleton only):

       m = rows (A); n = columns (A);
       [U, S, V] = svd (A);
       ## determine the regularization factor alpha
       ## alpha = ...
       ## transform to orthogonal basis
       b = U'*b;
       ## Use the standard formula, replacing A with S.
       ## S is diagonal, so the following will be very fast and accurate.
       x = (S'*S + alpha^2 * eye (n)) \ (S' * b);
       ## transform to solution basis
       x = V*x;

21.5 Differences in Treatment of Zero Elements
==============================================

Making diagonal and permutation matrices special matrix objects in their
own right and the consequent usage of smarter algorithms for certain
operations implies, as a side effect, small differences in treating
zeros.  The contents of this section apply also to sparse matrices,
discussed in the following chapter.  (*note Sparse Matrices::)

   The IEEE floating point standard defines the result of the
expressions ‘0*Inf’ and ‘0*NaN’ as ‘NaN’.  This is widely agreed to be a
good compromise.  Numerical software dealing with structured and sparse
matrices (including Octave) however, almost always makes a distinction
between a "numerical zero" and an "assumed zero".  A "numerical zero" is
a zero value occurring in a place where any floating-point value could
occur.  It is normally stored somewhere in memory as an explicit value.
An "assumed zero", on the contrary, is a zero matrix element implied by
the matrix structure (diagonal, triangular) or a sparsity pattern; its
value is usually not stored explicitly anywhere, but is implied by the
underlying data structure.

   The primary distinction is that an assumed zero, when multiplied by
any number, or divided by any nonzero number, yields *always* a zero,
even when, e.g., multiplied by ‘Inf’ or divided by ‘NaN’.  The reason
for this behavior is that the numerical multiplication is not actually
performed anywhere by the underlying algorithm; the result is just
assumed to be zero.  Equivalently, one can say that the part of the
computation involving assumed zeros is performed symbolically, not
numerically.

   This behavior not only facilitates the most straightforward and
efficient implementation of algorithms, but also preserves certain
useful invariants, like:

   • scalar * diagonal matrix is a diagonal matrix

   • sparse matrix / scalar preserves the sparsity pattern

   • permutation matrix * matrix is equivalent to permuting rows

   all of these natural mathematical truths would be invalidated by
treating assumed zeros as numerical ones.

   Note that MATLAB does not strictly follow this principle and converts
assumed zeros to numerical zeros in certain cases, while not doing so in
other cases.  As of today, there are no intentions to mimic such
behavior in Octave.

   Examples of effects of assumed zeros vs.  numerical zeros:

     Inf * eye (3)
     ⇒
        Inf     0     0
          0   Inf     0
          0     0   Inf

     Inf * speye (3)
     ⇒
     Compressed Column Sparse (rows = 3, cols = 3, nnz = 3 [33%])

       (1, 1) -> Inf
       (2, 2) -> Inf
       (3, 3) -> Inf

     Inf * full (eye (3))
     ⇒
        Inf   NaN   NaN
        NaN   Inf   NaN
        NaN   NaN   Inf


     diag (1:3) * [NaN; 1; 1]
     ⇒
        NaN
          2
          3

     sparse (1:3,1:3,1:3) * [NaN; 1; 1]
     ⇒
        NaN
          2
          3
     [1,0,0;0,2,0;0,0,3] * [NaN; 1; 1]
     ⇒
        NaN
        NaN
        NaN

22.1 Creation and Manipulation of Sparse Matrices
=================================================

The size of mathematical problems that can be treated at any particular
time is generally limited by the available computing resources.  Both,
the speed of the computer and its available memory place limitation on
the problem size.

   There are many classes of mathematical problems which give rise to
matrices, where a large number of the elements are zero.  In this case
it makes sense to have a special matrix type to handle this class of
problems where only the nonzero elements of the matrix are stored.  Not
only does this reduce the amount of memory to store the matrix, but it
also means that operations on this type of matrix can take advantage of
the a priori knowledge of the positions of the nonzero elements to
accelerate their calculations.

   A matrix type that stores only the nonzero elements is generally
called sparse.  It is the purpose of this document to discuss the basics
of the storage and creation of sparse matrices and the fundamental
operations on them.

22.1.1 Storage of Sparse Matrices
---------------------------------

It is not strictly speaking necessary for the user to understand how
sparse matrices are stored.  However, such an understanding will help to
get an understanding of the size of sparse matrices.  Understanding the
storage technique is also necessary for those users wishing to create
their own oct-files.

   There are many different means of storing sparse matrix data.  What
all of the methods have in common is that they attempt to reduce the
complexity and storage given a priori knowledge of the particular class
of problems that will be solved.  A good summary of the available
techniques for storing sparse matrix is given by Saad (1).  With full
matrices, knowledge of the point of an element of the matrix within the
matrix is implied by its position in the computers memory.  However,
this is not the case for sparse matrices, and so the positions of the
nonzero elements of the matrix must equally be stored.

   An obvious way to do this is by storing the elements of the matrix as
triplets, with two elements being their position in the array (rows and
column) and the third being the data itself.  This is conceptually easy
to grasp, but requires more storage than is strictly needed.

   The storage technique used within Octave is the compressed column
format.  It is similar to the Yale format.  (2)  In this format the
position of each element in a row and the data are stored as previously.
However, if we assume that all elements in the same column are stored
adjacent in the computers memory, then we only need to store information
on the number of nonzero elements in each column, rather than their
positions.  Thus assuming that the matrix has more nonzero elements than
there are columns in the matrix, we win in terms of the amount of memory
used.

   In fact, the column index contains one more element than the number
of columns, with the first element always being zero.  The advantage of
this is a simplification in the code, in that there is no special case
for the first or last columns.  A short example, demonstrating this in C
is.

       for (j = 0; j < nc; j++)
         for (i = cidx(j); i < cidx(j+1); i++)
            printf ("nonzero element (%i,%i) is %d\n",
                ridx(i), j, data(i));

   A clear understanding might be had by considering an example of how
the above applies to an example matrix.  Consider the matrix

         1   2   0  0
         0   0   0  3
         0   0   0  4

   The nonzero elements of this matrix are

        (1, 1)  ⇒ 1
        (1, 2)  ⇒ 2
        (2, 4)  ⇒ 3
        (3, 4)  ⇒ 4

   This will be stored as three vectors CIDX, RIDX and DATA,
representing the column indexing, row indexing and data respectively.
The contents of these three vectors for the above matrix will be

       CIDX = [0, 1, 2, 2, 4]
       RIDX = [0, 0, 1, 2]
       DATA = [1, 2, 3, 4]

   Note that this is the representation of these elements with the first
row and column assumed to start at zero, while in Octave itself the row
and column indexing starts at one.  Thus the number of elements in the
I-th column is given by ‘CIDX (I + 1) - CIDX (I)’.

   Although Octave uses a compressed column format, it should be noted
that compressed row formats are equally possible.  However, in the
context of mixed operations between mixed sparse and dense matrices, it
makes sense that the elements of the sparse matrices are in the same
order as the dense matrices.  Octave stores dense matrices in column
major ordering, and so sparse matrices are equally stored in this
manner.

   A further constraint on the sparse matrix storage used by Octave is
that all elements in the rows are stored in increasing order of their
row index, which makes certain operations faster.  However, it imposes
the need to sort the elements on the creation of sparse matrices.
Having disordered elements is potentially an advantage in that it makes
operations such as concatenating two sparse matrices together easier and
faster, however it adds complexity and speed problems elsewhere.

22.1.2 Creating Sparse Matrices
-------------------------------

There are several means to create sparse matrix.

Returned from a function
     There are many functions that directly return sparse matrices.
     These include “speye”, “sprand”, “diag”, etc.

Constructed from matrices or vectors
     The function “sparse” allows a sparse matrix to be constructed from
     three vectors representing the row, column and data.
     Alternatively, the function “spconvert” uses a three column matrix
     format to allow easy importation of data from elsewhere.

Created and then filled
     The function “sparse” or “spalloc” can be used to create an empty
     matrix that is then filled by the user

From a user binary program
     The user can directly create the sparse matrix within an oct-file.

   There are several basic functions to return specific sparse matrices.
For example the sparse identity matrix, is a matrix that is often
needed.  It therefore has its own function to create it as ‘speye (N)’
or ‘speye (R, C)’, which creates an N-by-N or R-by-C sparse identity
matrix.

   Another typical sparse matrix that is often needed is a random
distribution of random elements.  The functions “sprand” and “sprandn”
perform this for uniform and normal random distributions of elements.
They have exactly the same calling convention, where ‘sprand (R, C, D)’,
creates an R-by-C sparse matrix with a density of filled elements of D.

   Other functions of interest that directly create sparse matrices, are
“diag” or its generalization “spdiags”, that can take the definition of
the diagonals of the matrix and create the sparse matrix that
corresponds to this.  For example,

     s = diag (sparse (randn (1,n)), -1);

creates a sparse (N+1)-by-(N+1) sparse matrix with a single diagonal
defined.

 -- : B = spdiags (A)
 -- : [B, D] = spdiags (A)
 -- : B = spdiags (A, D)
 -- : A = spdiags (V, D, A)
 -- : A = spdiags (V, D, M, N)
     A generalization of the function ‘diag’.

     Called with a single input argument, the nonzero diagonals D of A
     are extracted.

     With two arguments the diagonals to extract are given by the vector
     D.

     The other two forms of ‘spdiags’ modify the input matrix by
     replacing the diagonals.  They use the columns of V to replace the
     diagonals represented by the vector D.  If the sparse matrix A is
     defined then the diagonals of this matrix are replaced.  Otherwise
     a matrix of M by N is created with the diagonals given by the
     columns of V.

     Negative values of D represent diagonals below the main diagonal,
     and positive values of D diagonals above the main diagonal.

     For example:

          spdiags (reshape (1:12, 4, 3), [-1 0 1], 5, 4)
             ⇒ 5 10  0  0
                1  6 11  0
                0  2  7 12
                0  0  3  8
                0  0  0  4

     See also: *note diag: XREFdiag.

 -- : S = speye (M, N)
 -- : S = speye (M)
 -- : S = speye (SZ)
     Return a sparse identity matrix of size MxN.

     The implementation is significantly more efficient than ‘sparse
     (eye (M))’ as the full matrix is not constructed.

     Called with a single argument a square matrix of size M-by-M is
     created.  If called with a single vector argument SZ, this argument
     is taken to be the size of the matrix to create.

     See also: *note sparse: XREFsparse, *note spdiags: XREFspdiags,
     *note eye: XREFeye.

 -- : R = spones (S)
     Replace the nonzero entries of S with ones.

     This creates a sparse matrix with the same structure as S.

     sprandn: XREFsprandn, *note sprandsym: XREFsprandsym, *note spfun:
     XREFspfun, *note spy: XREFspy.

 -- : sprand (M, N, D)
 -- : sprand (M, N, D, RC)
 -- : sprand (S)
     Generate a sparse matrix with uniformly distributed random values.

     The size of the matrix is MxN with a density of values D.  D must
     be between 0 and 1.  Values will be uniformly distributed on the
     interval (0, 1).

     If called with a single matrix argument, a sparse matrix is
     generated with random values wherever the matrix S is nonzero.

     If called with a scalar fourth argument RC, a random sparse matrix
     with reciprocal condition number RC is generated.  If RC is a
     vector, then it specifies the first singular values of the
     generated matrix (‘length (RC) <= min (M, N)’).

     See also: *note sprandn: XREFsprandn, *note sprandsym:
     XREFsprandsym, *note rand: XREFrand.

 -- : sprandn (M, N, D)
 -- : sprandn (M, N, D, RC)
 -- : sprandn (S)
     Generate a sparse matrix with normally distributed random values.

     The size of the matrix is MxN with a density of values D.  D must
     be between 0 and 1.  Values will be normally distributed with a
     mean of 0 and a variance of 1.

     If called with a single matrix argument, a sparse matrix is
     generated with random values wherever the matrix S is nonzero.

     If called with a scalar fourth argument RC, a random sparse matrix
     with reciprocal condition number RC is generated.  If RC is a
     vector, then it specifies the first singular values of the
     generated matrix (‘length (RC) <= min (M, N)’).

     See also: *note sprand: XREFsprand, *note sprandsym: XREFsprandsym,
     *note randn: XREFrandn.

 -- : sprandsym (N, D)
 -- : sprandsym (S)
     Generate a symmetric random sparse matrix.

     The size of the matrix will be NxN, with a density of values given
     by D.  D must be between 0 and 1 inclusive.  Values will be
     normally distributed with a mean of zero and a variance of 1.

     If called with a single matrix argument, a random sparse matrix is
     generated wherever the matrix S is nonzero in its lower triangular
     part.

     See also: *note sprand: XREFsprand, *note sprandn: XREFsprandn,
     *note spones: XREFspones, *note sparse: XREFsparse.

   The recommended way for the user to create a sparse matrix, is to
create two vectors containing the row and column index of the data and a
third vector of the same size containing the data to be stored.  For
example,

       ri = ci = d = [];
       for j = 1:c
         ri = [ri; randperm(r,n)'];
         ci = [ci; j*ones(n,1)];
         d = [d; rand(n,1)];
       endfor
       s = sparse (ri, ci, d, r, c);

creates an R-by-C sparse matrix with a random distribution of N (<R)
elements per column.  The elements of the vectors do not need to be
sorted in any particular order as Octave will sort them prior to storing
the data.  However, pre-sorting the data will make the creation of the
sparse matrix faster.

   The function “spconvert” takes a three or four column real matrix.
The first two columns represent the row and column index respectively
and the third and four columns, the real and imaginary parts of the
sparse matrix.  The matrix can contain zero elements and the elements
can be sorted in any order.  Adding zero elements is a convenient way to
define the size of the sparse matrix.  For example:

     s = spconvert ([1 2 3 4; 1 3 4 4; 1 2 3 0]')
     ⇒ Compressed Column Sparse (rows=4, cols=4, nnz=3)
           (1 , 1) -> 1
           (2 , 3) -> 2
           (3 , 4) -> 3

   An example of creating and filling a matrix might be

     k = 5;
     nz = r * k;
     s = spalloc (r, c, nz)
     for j = 1:c
       idx = randperm (r);
       s (:, j) = [zeros(r - k, 1); ...
             rand(k, 1)] (idx);
     endfor

   It should be noted, that due to the way that the Octave assignment
functions are written that the assignment will reallocate the memory
used by the sparse matrix at each iteration of the above loop.
Therefore the “spalloc” function ignores the NZ argument and does not
pre-assign the memory for the matrix.  Therefore, it is vitally
important that code using to above structure should be vectorized as
much as possible to minimize the number of assignments and reduce the
number of memory allocations.

 -- : FM = full (SM)
     Return a full storage matrix from a sparse, diagonal, or
     permutation matrix, or a range.

     See also: *note sparse: XREFsparse, *note issparse: XREFissparse.

 -- : S = spalloc (M, N, NZ)
     Create an M-by-N sparse matrix with pre-allocated space for at most
     NZ nonzero elements.

     This is useful for building a matrix incrementally by a sequence of
     indexed assignments.  Subsequent indexed assignments after
     ‘spalloc’ will reuse the pre-allocated memory, provided they are of
     one of the simple forms

        • ‘S(I:J) = X’

        • ‘S(:,I:J) = X’

        • ‘S(K:L,I:J) = X’

     and that the following conditions are met:

        • the assignment does not decrease ‘nnz (S)’.

        • after the assignment, ‘nnz (S)’ does not exceed NZ.

        • no index is out of bounds.

     Partial movement of data may still occur, but in general the
     assignment will be more memory and time efficient under these
     circumstances.  In particular, it is possible to efficiently build
     a pre-allocated sparse matrix from a contiguous block of columns.

     The amount of pre-allocated memory for a given matrix may be
     queried using the function ‘nzmax’.

     Programming Note: Octave always reserves memory for at least one
     value, even if NZ is 0.

     See also: *note nzmax: XREFnzmax, *note sparse: XREFsparse.

 -- : S = sparse (A)
 -- : S = sparse (I, J, SV, M, N)
 -- : S = sparse (I, J, SV)
 -- : S = sparse (M, N)
 -- : S = sparse (I, J, S, M, N, "unique")
 -- : S = sparse (I, J, SV, M, N, NZMAX)
     Create a sparse matrix from a full matrix, or row, column, value
     triplets.

     If A is a full matrix, convert it to a sparse matrix
     representation, removing all zero values in the process.

     Given the integer index vectors I and J, and a 1-by-‘nnz’ vector of
     real or complex values SV, construct the sparse matrix
     ‘S(I(K),J(K)) = SV(K)’ with overall dimensions M and N.  If any of
     SV, I or J are scalars, they are expanded to have a common size.

     If M or N are not specified their values are derived from the
     maximum index in the vectors I and J as given by ‘M = max (I)’, ‘N
     = max (J)’.

     *Note*: if multiple values are specified with the same I, J
     indices, the corresponding value in S will be the sum of the values
     at the repeated location.  *Note ‘accumarray’: XREFaccumarray, for
     an example of how to produce different behavior such as taking the
     minimum instead.

     If the option "unique" is given, and more than one value is
     specified at the same I, J indices, then the last specified value
     will be used.

     ‘sparse (M, N)’ will create an empty MxN sparse matrix and is
     equivalent to ‘sparse ([], [], [], M, N)’

     The argument NZMAX is ignored but accepted for compatibility with
     MATLAB.

     Example 1 (sum at repeated indices):

          I = [1 1 2]; J = [1 1 2]; SV = [3 4 5];
          sparse (I, J, SV, 3, 4)
          ⇒
             Compressed Column Sparse (rows = 3, cols = 4, nnz = 2 [17%])

               (1, 1) ->  7
               (2, 2) ->  5

     Example 2 ("unique" option):

          I = [1 1 2]; J = [1 1 2]; SV = [3 4 5];

     Convert a simple sparse matrix format easily generated by other
     programs into Octave’s internal sparse format.

     The input M is either a 3 or 4 column real matrix, containing the
     row, column, real, and imaginary parts of the elements of the
     sparse matrix.  An element with a zero real and imaginary part can
     be used to force a particular matrix size.

22.1.3 Finding Information about Sparse Matrices
------------------------------------------------

There are a number of functions that allow information concerning sparse
matrices to be obtained.  The most basic of these is “issparse” that
identifies whether a particular Octave object is in fact a sparse
matrix.

   Another very basic function is “nnz” that returns the number of
nonzero entries there are in a sparse matrix, while the function “nzmax”
returns the amount of storage allocated to the sparse matrix.  Note that
Octave tends to crop unused memory at the first opportunity for sparse
objects.  There are some cases of user created sparse objects where the
value returned by “nzmax” will not be the same as “nnz”, but in general
they will give the same result.  The function “spstats” returns some
basic statistics on the columns of a sparse matrix including the number
of elements, the mean and the variance of each column.

 -- : issparse (X)
     Return true if X is a sparse matrix.

     See also: *note ismatrix: XREFismatrix.

 -- : N = nnz (A)
     Return the number of nonzero elements in A.

     See also: *note nzmax: XREFnzmax, *note nonzeros: XREFnonzeros,
     *note find: XREFfind.

 -- : V = nonzeros (A)
     Return a column vector of the nonzero values of the matrix A.

     See also: *note find: XREFfind, *note nnz: XREFnnz.

 -- : N = nzmax (SM)
     Return the amount of storage allocated to the sparse matrix SM.

     Programming Note: Octave tends to crop unused memory at the first
     opportunity for sparse objects.  Thus, in general the value of
     ‘nzmax’ will be the same as ‘nnz’, except for some cases of
     user-created sparse objects.

     Also, note that Octave always reserves storage for at least one
     value.  Thus, for empty matrices ‘nnz’ will report 0, but ‘nzmax’
     will report 1.

     See also: *note nnz: XREFnnz, *note spalloc: XREFspalloc, *note
     sparse: XREFsparse.

 -- : [COUNT, MEAN, VAR] = spstats (S)
 -- : [COUNT, MEAN, VAR] = spstats (S, J)
     Return the stats for the nonzero elements of the sparse matrix S.

     COUNT is the number of nonzeros in each column, MEAN is the mean of
     the nonzeros in each column, and VAR is the variance of the
     nonzeros in each column.

     Called with two input arguments, if S is the data and J is the bin
     number for the data, compute the stats for each bin.  In this case,
     bins can contain data values of zero, whereas with ‘spstats (S)’
     the zeros may disappear.

   When solving linear equations involving sparse matrices Octave
determines the means to solve the equation based on the type of the
matrix (*note Sparse Linear Algebra::).  Octave probes the matrix type
when the div (/) or ldiv (\) operator is first used with the matrix and
then caches the type.  However the “matrix_type” function can be used to
determine the type of the sparse matrix prior to use of the div or ldiv
operators.  For example,

     a = tril (sprandn (1024, 1024, 0.02), -1) ...
         + speye (1024);
     matrix_type (a);
     ans = Lower

shows that Octave correctly determines the matrix type for lower
triangular matrices.  “matrix_type” can also be used to force the type
of a matrix to be a particular type.  For example:

     a = matrix_type (tril (sprandn (1024, ...
        1024, 0.02), -1) + speye (1024), "Lower");

   This allows the cost of determining the matrix type to be avoided.
However, incorrectly defining the matrix type will result in incorrect
results from solutions of linear equations, and so it is entirely the
responsibility of the user to correctly identify the matrix type

   There are several graphical means of finding out information about
sparse matrices.  The first is the “spy” command, which displays the
structure of the nonzero elements of the matrix.  *Note Figure 22.1:
fig:spmatrix, for an example of the use of “spy”.  More advanced
graphical information can be obtained with the “treeplot”, “etreeplot”
and “gplot” commands.

Figure 22.1: Structure of simple sparse matrix.

   One use of sparse matrices is in graph theory, where the
interconnections between nodes are represented as an adjacency matrix.
That is, if the i-th node in a graph is connected to the j-th node.
Then the ij-th node (and in the case of undirected graphs the ji-th
node) of the sparse adjacency matrix is nonzero.  If each node is then
associated with a set of coordinates, then the “gplot” command can be
used to graphically display the interconnections between nodes.

   As a trivial example of the use of “gplot” consider the example,

     A = sparse ([2,6,1,3,2,4,3,5,4,6,1,5],
         [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6],1,6,6);
     xy = [0,4,8,6,4,2;5,0,5,7,5,7]';
     gplot (A,xy)

which creates an adjacency matrix ‘A’ where node 1 is connected to nodes
2 and 6, node 2 with nodes 1 and 3, etc.  The coordinates of the nodes
are given in the n-by-2 matrix ‘xy’.

   The dependencies between the nodes of a Cholesky factorization can be
calculated in linear time without explicitly needing to calculate the
Cholesky factorization by the ‘etree’ command.  This command returns the
elimination tree of the matrix and can be displayed graphically by the
command ‘treeplot (etree (A))’ if ‘A’ is symmetric or ‘treeplot (etree
(A+A'))’ otherwise.

 -- : spy (X)
 -- : spy (..., MARKERSIZE)
 -- : spy (..., LINE_SPEC)
     Plot the sparsity pattern of the sparse matrix X.

     If the optional numeric argument MARKERSIZE is given, it determines
     the size of the markers used in the plot.

     If the optional string LINE_SPEC is given it is passed to ‘plot’
     and determines the appearance of the plot.

     See also: *note plot: XREFplot, *note gplot: XREFgplot.

 -- : P = etree (S)
 -- : P = etree (S, TYP)
 -- : [P, Q] = etree (S, TYP)

     Return the elimination tree for the matrix S.

     By default S is assumed to be symmetric and the symmetric
     elimination tree is returned.  The argument TYP controls whether a
     symmetric or column elimination tree is returned.  Valid values of
     TYP are "sym" or "col", for symmetric or column elimination tree
     respectively.

     Called with a second argument, ‘etree’ also returns the postorder
     permutations on the tree.

 -- : etreeplot (A)
 -- : etreeplot (A, NODE_STYLE, EDGE_STYLE)
     Plot the elimination tree of the matrix A or A+A’ if A in not
     symmetric.

     The optional parameters NODE_STYLE and EDGE_STYLE define the output
     style.

     See also: *note treeplot: XREFtreeplot, *note gplot: XREFgplot.

 -- : gplot (A, XY)
 -- : gplot (A, XY, LINE_STYLE)
 -- : [X, Y] = gplot (A, XY)
     Plot a graph defined by A and XY in the graph theory sense.

     A is the adjacency matrix of the array to be plotted and XY is an
     N-by-2 matrix containing the coordinates of the nodes of the graph.

     The optional parameter LINE_STYLE defines the output style for the
     plot.  Called with no output arguments the graph is plotted
     directly.  Otherwise, return the coordinates of the plot in X and
     Y.

     See also: *note treeplot: XREFtreeplot, *note etreeplot:
     XREFetreeplot, *note spy: XREFspy.

 -- : treeplot (TREE)
 -- : treeplot (TREE, NODE_STYLE, EDGE_STYLE)
     Produce a graph of tree or forest.

     The first argument is vector of predecessors.

     The optional parameters NODE_STYLE and EDGE_STYLE define the output
     plot style.

     The complexity of the algorithm is O(n) in terms of is time and
     memory requirements.

     See also: *note etreeplot: XREFetreeplot, *note gplot: XREFgplot.

 -- : treelayout (TREE)
 -- : treelayout (TREE, PERMUTATION)
     treelayout lays out a tree or a forest.

     The first argument TREE is a vector of predecessors.

     The parameter PERMUTATION is an optional postorder permutation.

     The complexity of the algorithm is O(n) in terms of time and memory
     requirements.

22.1.4.1 Sparse Functions
.........................

Many Octave functions have been overloaded to work with either sparse or
full matrices.  There is no difference in calling convention when using
an overloaded function with a sparse matrix, however, there is also no
access to potentially sparse-specific features.  At any time the sparse
matrix specific version of a function can be used by explicitly calling
its function name.

   The table below lists all of the sparse functions of Octave.  Note
that the names of the specific sparse forms of the functions are
typically the same as the general versions with a “sp” prefix.  In the
table below, and in the rest of this article, the specific sparse
versions of functions are used.

Generate sparse matrices:
     “spalloc”, “spdiags”, “speye”, “sprand”, “sprandn”, “sprandsym”

Sparse matrix conversion:
     “full”, “sparse”, “spconvert”

Manipulate sparse matrices
     “issparse”, “nnz”, “nonzeros”, “nzmax”, “spfun”, “spones”, “spy”

Graph Theory:
     “etree”, “etreeplot”, “gplot”, “treeplot”

Sparse matrix reordering:
     “amd”, “ccolamd”, “colamd”, “colperm”, “csymamd”, “dmperm”,
     “symamd”, “randperm”, “symrcm”

Linear algebra:
     “condest”, “eigs”, “matrix_type”, “normest”, “normest1”, “sprank”,
     “spaugment”, “svds”

Iterative techniques:
     “ichol”, “ilu”, “pcg”, “pcr”

Miscellaneous:
     “spparms”, “symbfact”, “spstats”

   In addition all of the standard Octave mapper functions (i.e., basic
math functions that take a single argument) such as “abs”, etc. can
accept sparse matrices.  The reader is referred to the documentation
supplied with these functions within Octave itself for further details.

22.1.4.2 Return Types of Operators and Functions
................................................

The two basic reasons to use sparse matrices are to reduce the memory
usage and to not have to do calculations on zero elements.  The two are
closely related in that the computation time on a sparse matrix operator
or function is roughly linear with the number of nonzero elements.

   Therefore, there is a certain density of nonzero elements of a matrix
where it no longer makes sense to store it as a sparse matrix, but
rather as a full matrix.  For this reason operators and functions that
have a high probability of returning a full matrix will always return
one.  For example adding a scalar constant to a sparse matrix will
almost always make it a full matrix, and so the example,

     speye (3) + 0
     ⇒   1  0  0
       0  1  0
       0  0  1

returns a full matrix as can be seen.

   Additionally, if ‘sparse_auto_mutate’ is true, all sparse functions
test the amount of memory occupied by the sparse matrix to see if the
amount of storage used is larger than the amount used by the full
equivalent.  Therefore ‘speye (2) * 1’ will return a full matrix as the
memory used is smaller for the full version than the sparse version.

   As all of the mixed operators and functions between full and sparse
matrices exist, in general this does not cause any problems.  However,
one area where it does cause a problem is where a sparse matrix is
promoted to a full matrix, where subsequent operations would resparsify
the matrix.  Such cases are rare, but can be artificially created, for
example ‘(fliplr (speye (3)) + speye (3)) - speye (3)’ gives a full
matrix when it should give a sparse one.  In general, where such cases
occur, they impose only a small memory penalty.

   There is however one known case where this behavior of Octave’s
sparse matrices will cause a problem.  That is in the handling of the
“diag” function.  Whether “diag” returns a sparse or full matrix
depending on the type of its input arguments.  So

      a = diag (sparse ([1,2,3]), -1);

should return a sparse matrix.  To ensure this actually happens, the
“sparse” function, and other functions based on it like “speye”, always
returns a sparse matrix, even if the memory used will be larger than its
full representation.

 -- : VAL = sparse_auto_mutate ()
 -- : OLD_VAL = sparse_auto_mutate (NEW_VAL)
 -- : sparse_auto_mutate (NEW_VAL, "local")
     Query or set the internal variable that controls whether Octave
     will automatically mutate sparse matrices to full matrices to save
     memory.

     For example:

          s = speye (3);
          sparse_auto_mutate (false);
          s(:, 1) = 1;
          typeinfo (s)
          ⇒ sparse matrix
          sparse_auto_mutate (true);
          s(1, :) = 1;
          typeinfo (s)
          ⇒ matrix

     When called from inside a function with the "local" option, the
     variable is changed locally for the function and any subroutines it
     calls.  The original variable value is restored when exiting the
     function.

   Note that the ‘sparse_auto_mutate’ option is incompatible with
MATLAB, and so it is off by default.

22.1.4.3 Mathematical Considerations
....................................

The attempt has been made to make sparse matrices behave in exactly the
same manner as there full counterparts.  However, there are certain
differences and especially differences with other products sparse
implementations.

   First, the "./" and ".^" operators must be used with care.  Consider
what the examples

       s = speye (4);
       a1 = s .^ 2;
       a2 = s .^ s;
       a3 = s .^ -2;
       a4 = s ./ 2;
       a5 = 2 ./ s;
       a6 = s ./ s;

will give.  The first example of S raised to the power of 2 causes no
problems.  However S raised element-wise to itself involves a large
number of terms ‘0 .^ 0’ which is 1.  There ‘S .^ S’ is a full matrix.

   Likewise ‘S .^ -2’ involves terms like ‘0 .^ -2’ which is infinity,
and so ‘S .^ -2’ is equally a full matrix.

   For the "./" operator ‘S ./ 2’ has no problems, but ‘2 ./ S’ involves
a large number of infinity terms as well and is equally a full matrix.
The case of ‘S ./ S’ involves terms like ‘0 ./ 0’ which is a ‘NaN’ and
so this is equally a full matrix with the zero elements of S filled with
‘NaN’ values.

   The above behavior is consistent with full matrices, but is not
consistent with sparse implementations in other products.

   A particular problem of sparse matrices comes about due to the fact
that as the zeros are not stored, the sign-bit of these zeros is equally
not stored.  In certain cases the sign-bit of zero is important.  For
example:

      a = 0 ./ [-1, 1; 1, -1];
      b = 1 ./ a
      ⇒ -Inf            Inf
          Inf           -Inf
      c = 1 ./ sparse (a)
      ⇒  Inf            Inf
          Inf            Inf

   To correct this behavior would mean that zero elements with a
negative sign-bit would need to be stored in the matrix to ensure that
their sign-bit was respected.  This is not done at this time, for
reasons of efficiency, and so the user is warned that calculations where
the sign-bit of zero is important must not be done using sparse
matrices.

   In general any function or operator used on a sparse matrix will
result in a sparse matrix with the same or a larger number of nonzero
elements than the original matrix.  This is particularly true for the
important case of sparse matrix factorizations.  The usual way to
address this is to reorder the matrix, such that its factorization is
sparser than the factorization of the original matrix.  That is the
factorization of ‘L * U = P * S * Q’ has sparser terms ‘L’ and ‘U’ than
the equivalent factorization ‘L * U = S’.

   Several functions are available to reorder depending on the type of
the matrix to be factorized.  If the matrix is symmetric
positive-definite, then “symamd” or “csymamd” should be used.  Otherwise
“amd”, “colamd” or “ccolamd” should be used.  For completeness the
reordering functions “colperm” and “randperm” are also available.

   *Note Figure 22.2: fig:simplematrix, for an example of the structure
of a simple positive definite matrix.

Figure 22.2: Structure of simple sparse matrix.

   The standard Cholesky factorization of this matrix can be obtained by
the same command that would be used for a full matrix.  This can be
visualized with the command ‘r = chol (A); spy (r);’.  *Note Figure
22.3: fig:simplechol.  The original matrix had 43 nonzero terms, while
this Cholesky factorization has 71, with only half of the symmetric
matrix being stored.  This is a significant level of fill in, and
although not an issue for such a small test case, can represents a large
overhead in working with other sparse matrices.

   The appropriate sparsity preserving permutation of the original
matrix is given by “symamd” and the factorization using this reordering
can be visualized using the command ‘q = symamd (A); r = chol (A(q,q));
spy (r)’.  This gives 29 nonzero terms which is a significant
improvement.

   The Cholesky factorization itself can be used to determine the
appropriate sparsity preserving reordering of the matrix during the
factorization, In that case this might be obtained with three return
arguments as ‘[r, p, q] = chol (A); spy (r)’.

Figure 22.4: Structure of the permuted Cholesky factorization of the
above matrix.

   In the case of an asymmetric matrix, the appropriate sparsity
preserving permutation is “colamd” and the factorization using this
reordering can be visualized using the command ‘q = colamd (A); [l, u,
p] = lu (A(:,q)); spy (l+u)’.

   Finally, Octave implicitly reorders the matrix when using the div (/)
and ldiv (\) operators, and so no the user does not need to explicitly
reorder the matrix to maximize performance.

 -- : P = amd (S)
 -- : P = amd (S, OPTS)

     Return the approximate minimum degree permutation of a matrix.

     This is a permutation such that the Cholesky factorization of ‘S
     (P, P)’ tends to be sparser than the Cholesky factorization of S
     itself.  ‘amd’ is typically faster than ‘symamd’ but serves a
     similar purpose.

     The optional parameter OPTS is a structure that controls the
     behavior of ‘amd’.  The fields of the structure are

     OPTS.dense
          Determines what ‘amd’ considers to be a dense row or column of
          the input matrix.  Rows or columns with more than ‘max (16,
          (dense * sqrt (N)))’ entries, where N is the order of the
          matrix S, are ignored by ‘amd’ during the calculation of the
          permutation.  The value of dense must be a positive scalar and
          the default value is 10.0

     OPTS.aggressive
          If this value is a nonzero scalar, then ‘amd’ performs
          aggressive absorption.  The default is not to perform
          aggressive absorption.

     The author of the code itself is Timothy A. Davis (see
     <http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html>).

 -- : P = ccolamd (S)
 -- : P = ccolamd (S, KNOBS)
 -- : P = ccolamd (S, KNOBS, CMEMBER)
 -- : [P, STATS] = ccolamd (...)

     Constrained column approximate minimum degree permutation.

     ‘P = ccolamd (S)’ returns the column approximate minimum degree
     permutation vector for the sparse matrix S.  For a non-symmetric
     matrix S, ‘S(:, P)’ tends to have sparser LU factors than S.  ‘chol
     (S(:, P)' * S(:, P))’ also tends to be sparser than ‘chol (S' *
     S)’.  ‘P = ccolamd (S, 1)’ optimizes the ordering for ‘lu (S(:,
     P))’.  The ordering is followed by a column elimination tree
     post-ordering.

     KNOBS is an optional 1-element to 5-element input vector, with a
     default value of ‘[0 10 10 1 0]’ if not present or empty.  Entries
     not present are set to their defaults.

     ‘KNOBS(1)’
          if nonzero, the ordering is optimized for ‘lu (S(:, p))’.  It
          will be a poor ordering for ‘chol (S(:, P)' * S(:, P))’.  This
          is the most important knob for ccolamd.

     ‘KNOBS(2)’
          if S is m-by-n, rows with more than ‘max (16, KNOBS(2) * sqrt
          (n))’ entries are ignored.

     ‘KNOBS(3)’
          columns with more than ‘max (16, KNOBS(3) * sqrt (min (M,
          N)))’ entries are ignored and ordered last in the output
          permutation (subject to the cmember constraints).

     ‘KNOBS(4)’
          if nonzero, aggressive absorption is performed.

     ‘KNOBS(5)’
          if nonzero, statistics and knobs are printed.

     CMEMBER is an optional vector of length n.  It defines the
     constraints on the column ordering.  If ‘CMEMBER(j) = C’, then
     column J is in constraint set C (C must be in the range 1 to n).
     In the output permutation P, all columns in set 1 appear first,
     followed by all columns in set 2, and so on.  ‘CMEMBER = ones
     (1,n)’ if not present or empty.  ‘ccolamd (S, [], 1 : n)’ returns
     ‘1 : n’

     ‘P = ccolamd (S)’ is about the same as ‘P = colamd (S)’.  KNOBS and
     its default values differ.  ‘colamd’ always does aggressive
     absorption, and it finds an ordering suitable for both ‘lu (S(:,
     P))’ and ‘chol (S(:, P)' * S(:, P))’; it cannot optimize its
     ordering for ‘lu (S(:, P))’ to the extent that ‘ccolamd (S, 1)’
     can.

     STATS is an optional 20-element output vector that provides data
     about the ordering and the validity of the input matrix S.
     Ordering statistics are in ‘STATS(1 : 3)’.  ‘STATS(1)’ and
     ‘STATS(2)’ are the number of dense or empty rows and columns
     ignored by CCOLAMD and ‘STATS(3)’ is the number of garbage
     collections performed on the internal data structure used by
     CCOLAMD (roughly of size ‘2.2 * nnz (S) + 4 * M + 7 * N’ integers).

     ‘STATS(4 : 7)’ provide information if CCOLAMD was able to continue.
     The matrix is OK if ‘STATS(4)’ is zero, or 1 if invalid.
     ‘STATS(5)’ is the rightmost column index that is unsorted or
     contains duplicate entries, or zero if no such column exists.
     ‘STATS(6)’ is the last seen duplicate or out-of-order row index in
     the column index given by ‘STATS(5)’, or zero if no such row index
     exists.  ‘STATS(7)’ is the number of duplicate or out-of-order row
     indices.  ‘STATS(8 : 20)’ is always zero in the current version of
     CCOLAMD (reserved for future use).

     The authors of the code itself are S. Larimore, T. Davis and S.

 -- : P = colamd (S)
 -- : P = colamd (S, KNOBS)
 -- : [P, STATS] = colamd (S)
 -- : [P, STATS] = colamd (S, KNOBS)

     Compute the column approximate minimum degree permutation.

     ‘P = colamd (S)’ returns the column approximate minimum degree
     permutation vector for the sparse matrix S.  For a non-symmetric
     matrix S, ‘S(:,P)’ tends to have sparser LU factors than S.  The
     Cholesky factorization of ‘S(:,P)' * S(:,P)’ also tends to be
     sparser than that of ‘S' * S’.

     KNOBS is an optional one- to three-element input vector.  If S is
     m-by-n, then rows with more than ‘max(16,KNOBS(1)*sqrt(n))’ entries
     are ignored.  Columns with more than ‘max
     (16,KNOBS(2)*sqrt(min(m,n)))’ entries are removed prior to
     ordering, and ordered last in the output permutation P.  Only
     completely dense rows or columns are removed if ‘KNOBS(1)’ and
     ‘KNOBS(2)’ are < 0, respectively.  If ‘KNOBS(3)’ is nonzero, STATS
     and KNOBS are printed.  The default is ‘KNOBS = [10 10 0]’.  Note
     that KNOBS differs from earlier versions of colamd.

     STATS is an optional 20-element output vector that provides data
     about the ordering and the validity of the input matrix S.
     Ordering statistics are in ‘STATS(1:3)’.  ‘STATS(1)’ and ‘STATS(2)’
     are the number of dense or empty rows and columns ignored by COLAMD
     and ‘STATS(3)’ is the number of garbage collections performed on
     the internal data structure used by COLAMD (roughly of size ‘2.2 *
     nnz(S) + 4 * M + 7 * N’ integers).

     Octave built-in functions are intended to generate valid sparse
     matrices, with no duplicate entries, with ascending row indices of
     the nonzeros in each column, with a non-negative number of entries
     in each column (!)  and so on.  If a matrix is invalid, then COLAMD
     may or may not be able to continue.  If there are duplicate entries
     (a row index appears two or more times in the same column) or if
     the row indices in a column are out of order, then COLAMD can
     correct these errors by ignoring the duplicate entries and sorting
     each column of its internal copy of the matrix S (the input matrix
     S is not repaired, however).  If a matrix is invalid in other ways
     then COLAMD cannot continue, an error message is printed, and no
     output arguments (P or STATS) are returned.  COLAMD is thus a
     simple way to check a sparse matrix to see if it’s valid.

     ‘STATS(4:7)’ provide information if COLAMD was able to continue.
     The matrix is OK if ‘STATS(4)’ is zero, or 1 if invalid.
     ‘STATS(5)’ is the rightmost column index that is unsorted or
     contains duplicate entries, or zero if no such column exists.
     ‘STATS(6)’ is the last seen duplicate or out-of-order row index in
     the column index given by ‘STATS(5)’, or zero if no such row index
     exists.  ‘STATS(7)’ is the number of duplicate or out-of-order row
     indices.  ‘STATS(8:20)’ is always zero in the current version of
     COLAMD (reserved for future use).

     The ordering is followed by a column elimination tree
     post-ordering.

     The authors of the code itself are Stefan I. Larimore and Timothy
     A. Davis.  The algorithm was developed in collaboration with John
     Gilbert, Xerox PARC, and Esmond Ng, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

 -- : P = colperm (S)
     Return the column permutations such that the columns of ‘S(:, P)’
     are ordered in terms of increasing number of nonzero elements.

     If S is symmetric, then P is chosen such that ‘S(P, P)’ orders the
     rows and columns with increasing number of nonzero elements.

 -- : P = csymamd (S)
 -- : P = csymamd (S, KNOBS)
 -- : P = csymamd (S, KNOBS, CMEMBER)

     For a symmetric positive definite matrix S, return the permutation
     vector P such that ‘S(P,P)’ tends to have a sparser Cholesky factor
     than S.

     Sometimes ‘csymamd’ works well for symmetric indefinite matrices
     too.  The matrix S is assumed to be symmetric; only the strictly
     lower triangular part is referenced.  S must be square.  The
     ordering is followed by an elimination tree post-ordering.

     KNOBS is an optional 1-element to 3-element input vector, with a
     default value of ‘[10 1 0]’.  Entries not present are set to their
     defaults.

     ‘KNOBS(1)’
          If S is n-by-n, then rows and columns with more than
          ‘max(16,KNOBS(1)*sqrt(n))’ entries are ignored, and ordered
          last in the output permutation (subject to the cmember
          constraints).

     ‘KNOBS(2)’
          If nonzero, aggressive absorption is performed.

     ‘KNOBS(3)’
          If nonzero, statistics and knobs are printed.

     CMEMBER is an optional vector of length n.  It defines the
     constraints on the ordering.  If ‘CMEMBER(j) = S’, then row/column
     j is in constraint set C (C must be in the range 1 to n).  In the
     output permutation P, rows/columns in set 1 appear first, followed
     by all rows/columns in set 2, and so on.  ‘CMEMBER = ones (1,n)’ if
     not present or empty.  ‘csymamd (S,[],1:n)’ returns ‘1:n’.

     ‘P = csymamd (S)’ is about the same as ‘P = symamd (S)’.  KNOBS and
     its default values differ.

     ‘STATS(4:7)’ provide information if CCOLAMD was able to continue.
     The matrix is OK if ‘STATS(4)’ is zero, or 1 if invalid.
     ‘STATS(5)’ is the rightmost column index that is unsorted or

     ‘STATS(6)’ is the last seen duplicate or out-of-order row index in
     the column index given by ‘STATS(5)’, or zero if no such row index
     exists.  ‘STATS(7)’ is the number of duplicate or out-of-order row

 -- : P = dmperm (A)
 -- : [P, Q, R, S, CC, RR] = dmperm (A)

     Perform a Dulmage-Mendelsohn permutation of the sparse matrix A.

     With a single output argument ‘dmperm’, return a maximum matching P
     such that ‘p(j) = i’ if column J is matched to row I, or 0 if
     column J is unmatched.  If A is square and full structural rank, P
     is a row permutation and ‘A(p,:)’ has a zero-free diagonal.  The
     structural rank of A is ‘sprank(A) = sum(p>0)’.

     Called with two or more output arguments, return the
     Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition of A.  P and Q are permutation
     vectors.  CC and RR are vectors of length 5.  ‘c = A(p,q)’ is split
     into a 4-by-4 set of coarse blocks:

             A11 A12 A13 A14
              0  0   A23 A24
              0  0    0  A34
              0  0    0  A44

     where ‘A12’, ‘A23’, and ‘A34’ are square with zero-free diagonals.
     The columns of ‘A11’ are the unmatched columns, and the rows of
     ‘A44’ are the unmatched rows.  Any of these blocks can be empty.
     In the "coarse" decomposition, the (i,j)-th block is
     ‘C(rr(i):rr(i+1)-1,cc(j):cc(j+1)-1)’.  In terms of a linear system,
     ‘[A11 A12]’ is the underdetermined part of the system (it is always
     rectangular and with more columns and rows, or 0-by-0), ‘A23’ is
     the well-determined part of the system (it is always square), and
     ‘[A34 ; A44]’ is the over-determined part of the system (it is
     always rectangular with more rows than columns, or 0-by-0).

     The structural rank of A is ‘sprank (A) = rr(4)-1’, which is an
     upper bound on the numerical rank of A.  ‘sprank(A) =
     rank(full(sprand(A)))’ with probability 1 in exact arithmetic.

     The ‘A23’ submatrix is further subdivided into block upper
     triangular form via the "fine" decomposition (the
     strongly-connected components of ‘A23’).  If A is square and
     structurally non-singular, ‘A23’ is the entire matrix.

     ‘C(r(i):r(i+1)-1,s(j):s(j+1)-1)’ is the (i,j)-th block of the fine
     decomposition.  The (1,1) block is the rectangular block ‘[A11
     A12]’, unless this block is 0-by-0.  The (b,b) block is the
     rectangular block ‘[A34 ; A44]’, unless this block is 0-by-0, where
     ‘b = length(r)-1’.  All other blocks of the form
     ‘C(r(i):r(i+1)-1,s(i):s(i+1)-1)’ are diagonal blocks of ‘A23’, and
     are square with a zero-free diagonal.

     The method used is described in: A. Pothen & C.-J. Fan.  ‘Computing
     the Block Triangular Form of a Sparse Matrix’.  ACM Trans. Math.
     Software, 16(4):303–324, 1990.

 -- : P = symamd (S)
 -- : P = symamd (S, KNOBS)
 -- : [P, STATS] = symamd (S)
 -- : [P, STATS] = symamd (S, KNOBS)

     For a symmetric positive definite matrix S, returns the permutation
     vector p such that ‘S(P, P)’ tends to have a sparser
     Cholesky factor than S.

     Sometimes ‘symamd’ works well for symmetric indefinite matrices
     too.  The matrix S is assumed to be symmetric; only the strictly
     lower triangular part is referenced.  S must be square.

     KNOBS is an optional one- to two-element input vector.  If S is
     n-by-n, then rows and columns with more than ‘max
     (16,KNOBS(1)*sqrt(n))’ entries are removed prior to ordering, and
     ordered last in the output permutation P.  No rows/columns are
     removed if ‘KNOBS(1) < 0’.  If ‘KNOBS(2)’ is nonzero, STATS and
     KNOBS are printed.  The default is ‘KNOBS = [10 0]’.  Note that
     KNOBS differs from earlier versions of ‘symamd’.

     STATS is an optional 20-element output vector that provides data
     about the ordering and the validity of the input matrix S.
     Ordering statistics are in ‘STATS(1:3)’.  ‘STATS(1) = STATS(2)’ is
     the number of dense or empty rows and columns ignored by SYMAMD and
     ‘STATS(3)’ is the number of garbage collections performed on the
     internal data structure used by SYMAMD (roughly of size ‘8.4 * nnz
     (tril (S, -1)) + 9 * N’ integers).

     Octave built-in functions are intended to generate valid sparse
     matrices, with no duplicate entries, with ascending row indices of
     the nonzeros in each column, with a non-negative number of entries
     in each column (!)  and so on.  If a matrix is invalid, then SYMAMD
     may or may not be able to continue.  If there are duplicate entries
     (a row index appears two or more times in the same column) or if
     the row indices in a column are out of order, then SYMAMD can
     correct these errors by ignoring the duplicate entries and sorting
     each column of its internal copy of the matrix S (the input matrix
     S is not repaired, however).  If a matrix is invalid in other ways
     then SYMAMD cannot continue, an error message is printed, and no
     output arguments (P or STATS) are returned.  SYMAMD is thus a
     simple way to check a sparse matrix to see if it’s valid.

     ‘STATS(4:7)’ provide information if SYMAMD was able to continue.
     The matrix is OK if ‘STATS (4)’ is zero, or 1 if invalid.
     ‘STATS(5)’ is the rightmost column index that is unsorted or
     contains duplicate entries, or zero if no such column exists.
     ‘STATS(6)’ is the last seen duplicate or out-of-order row index in
     the column index given by ‘STATS(5)’, or zero if no such row index
     exists.  ‘STATS(7)’ is the number of duplicate or out-of-order row
     indices.  ‘STATS(8:20)’ is always zero in the current version of
     SYMAMD (reserved for future use).

     The ordering is followed by a column elimination tree
     post-ordering.

 -- : P = symrcm (S)
     Return the symmetric reverse Cuthill-McKee permutation of S.

     P is a permutation vector such that ‘S(P, P)’ tends to have its
     diagonal elements closer to the diagonal than S.  This is a good
     preordering for LU or Cholesky factorization of matrices that come
     from “long, skinny” problems.  It works for both symmetric and
     asymmetric S.

     The algorithm represents a heuristic approach to the NP-complete
     bandwidth minimization problem.  The implementation is based in the

22.2 Linear Algebra on Sparse Matrices
======================================

Octave includes a polymorphic solver for sparse matrices, where the
exact solver used to factorize the matrix, depends on the properties of
the sparse matrix itself.  Generally, the cost of determining the matrix
type is small relative to the cost of factorizing the matrix itself, but
in any case the matrix type is cached once it is calculated, so that it
is not re-determined each time it is used in a linear equation.

   The selection tree for how the linear equation is solve is

  1. If the matrix is diagonal, solve directly and goto 8

  2. If the matrix is a permuted diagonal, solve directly taking into
     account the permutations.  Goto 8

  3. If the matrix is square, banded and if the band density is less
     than that given by ‘spparms ("bandden")’ continue, else goto 4.

       a. If the matrix is tridiagonal and the right-hand side is not
          sparse continue, else goto 3b.

            1. If the matrix is Hermitian, with a positive real
               diagonal, attempt Cholesky factorization using LAPACK
               xPTSV.

            2. If the above failed or the matrix is not Hermitian with a
               positive real diagonal use Gaussian elimination with
               pivoting using LAPACK xGTSV, and goto 8.

       b. If the matrix is Hermitian with a positive real diagonal,
          attempt Cholesky factorization using LAPACK xPBTRF.

       c. if the above failed or the matrix is not Hermitian with a
          positive real diagonal use Gaussian elimination with pivoting
          using LAPACK xGBTRF, and goto 8.

  4. If the matrix is upper or lower triangular perform a sparse forward
     or backward substitution, and goto 8

  5. If the matrix is an upper triangular matrix with column
     permutations or lower triangular matrix with row permutations,
     perform a sparse forward or backward substitution, and goto 8

  6. If the matrix is square, Hermitian with a real positive diagonal,
     attempt sparse Cholesky factorization using CHOLMOD.

  7. If the sparse Cholesky factorization failed or the matrix is not
     Hermitian with a real positive diagonal, and the matrix is square,
     factorize, solve, and perform one refinement iteration using
     UMFPACK.

  8. If the matrix is not square, or any of the previous solvers flags a
     singular or near singular matrix, find a minimum norm solution
     using CXSPARSE(1).

   The band density is defined as the number of nonzero values in the
band divided by the total number of values in the full band.  The banded
matrix solvers can be entirely disabled by using “spparms” to set
‘bandden’ to 1 (i.e., ‘spparms ("bandden", 1)’).

   The QR solver factorizes the problem with a Dulmage-Mendelsohn
decomposition, to separate the problem into blocks that can be treated
as over-determined, multiple well determined blocks, and a final
over-determined block.  For matrices with blocks of strongly connected
nodes this is a big win as LU decomposition can be used for many blocks.
It also significantly improves the chance of finding a solution to
over-determined problems rather than just returning a vector of “NaN”’s.

   All of the solvers above, can calculate an estimate of the condition
number.  This can be used to detect numerical stability problems in the
solution and force a minimum norm solution to be used.  However, for
narrow banded, triangular or diagonal matrices, the cost of calculating
the condition number is significant, and can in fact exceed the cost of
factoring the matrix.  Therefore the condition number is not calculated
in these cases, and Octave relies on simpler techniques to detect
singular matrices or the underlying LAPACK code in the case of banded
matrices.

   The user can force the type of the matrix with the ‘matrix_type’
function.  This overcomes the cost of discovering the type of the
matrix.  However, it should be noted that identifying the type of the
matrix incorrectly will lead to unpredictable results, and so
‘matrix_type’ should be used with care.

 -- : NEST = normest (A)
 -- : NEST = normest (A, TOL)
 -- : [NEST, ITER] = normest (...)
     Estimate the 2-norm of the matrix A using a power series analysis.

     This is typically used for large matrices, where the cost of
     calculating ‘norm (A)’ is prohibitive and an approximation to the
     2-norm is acceptable.

     TOL is the tolerance to which the 2-norm is calculated.  By default
     TOL is 1e-6.

     The optional output ITER returns the number of iterations that were
     required for ‘normest’ to converge.

     Estimate the 1-norm of the matrix A using a block algorithm.

     ‘normest1’ is best for large sparse matrices where only an estimate
     of the norm is required.  For small to medium sized matrices,
     consider using ‘norm (A, 1)’.  In addition, ‘normest1’ can be used
     for the estimate of the 1-norm of a linear operator A when
     matrix-vector products ‘A * X’ and ‘A' * X’ can be cheaply
     computed.  In this case, instead of the matrix A, a function ‘AFUN
     (FLAG, X)’ is used; it must return:

        • the dimension N of A, if FLAG is "dim"

        • true if A is a real operator, if FLAG is "real"

        • the result ‘A * X’, if FLAG is "notransp"

        • the result ‘A' * X’, if FLAG is "transp"

     A typical case is A defined by ‘B ^ M’, in which the result ‘A * X’
     can be computed without even forming explicitly ‘B ^ M’ by:

          Y = X;
          for I = 1:M
            Y = B * Y;
          endfor

     The parameters P1, P2, ... are arguments of ‘AFUN (FLAG, X, P1, P2,
     ...)’.

     The default value for T is 2.  The algorithm requires matrix-matrix
     products with sizes N x N and N x T.

     The initial matrix X0 should have columns of unit 1-norm.  The
     default initial matrix X0 has the first column ‘ones (N, 1) / N’
     and, if T > 1, the remaining columns with random elements ‘-1 / N’,
     ‘1 / N’, divided by N.

     On output, NEST is the desired estimate, V and W are vectors such
     that ‘W = A * V’, with ‘norm (W, 1)’ = ‘C * norm (V, 1)’.  ITER
     contains in ‘ITER(1)’ the number of iterations (the maximum is
     hardcoded to 5) and in ‘ITER(2)’ the total number of products ‘A *
     X’ or ‘A' * X’ performed by the algorithm.

     Algorithm Note: ‘normest1’ uses random numbers during evaluation.
     Therefore, if consistent results are required, the "state" of the
     random generator should be fixed before invoking ‘normest1’.

     Estimate the 1-norm condition number of a square matrix A using T
     test vectors and a randomized 1-norm estimator.

     The optional input T specifies the number of test vectors (default
     5).

     The input may be a matrix A (the algorithm is particularly
     appropriate for large, sparse matrices).  Alternatively, the
     behavior of the matrix can be defined implicitly by functions.
     When using an implicit definition, ‘condest’ requires the following
     functions:

        − ‘AFCN (FLAG, X)’ which must return

             • the dimension N of A, if FLAG is "dim"

             • true if A is a real operator, if FLAG is "real"

             • the result ‘A * X’, if FLAG is "notransp"

             • the result ‘A' * X’, if FLAG is "transp"

        − ‘AINVFCN (FLAG, X)’ which must return

             • the dimension N of ‘inv (A)’, if FLAG is "dim"

             • true if ‘inv (A)’ is a real operator, if FLAG is "real"

             • the result ‘inv (A) * X’, if FLAG is "notransp"

             • the result ‘inv (A)' * X’, if FLAG is "transp"

     Any parameters P1, P2, ... are additional arguments of ‘AFCN (FLAG,
     X, P1, P2, ...)’ and ‘AINVFCN (FLAG, X, P1, P2, ...)’.

     The principal output is the 1-norm condition number estimate CEST.

     The optional second output V is an approximate null vector; it
     satisfies the equation ‘norm (A*V, 1) == norm (A, 1) * norm (V, 1)
     / CEST’.

     Algorithm Note: ‘condest’ uses a randomized algorithm to
     approximate the 1-norms.  Therefore, if consistent results are
     required, the "state" of the random generator should be fixed
     before invoking ‘condest’.

 -- : P = sprank (S)

     Calculate the structural rank of the sparse matrix S.

     Note that only the structure of the matrix is used in this
     calculation based on a Dulmage-Mendelsohn permutation to block
     triangular form.  As such the numerical rank of the matrix S is
     bounded by ‘sprank (S) >= rank (S)’.  Ignoring floating point
     errors ‘sprank (S) == rank (S)’.

 -- : [COUNT, H, PARENT, POST, R] = symbfact (S)
 -- : [...] = symbfact (S, TYP)
 -- : [...] = symbfact (S, TYP, MODE)

     Perform a symbolic factorization analysis of the sparse matrix S.

     The input variables are

     S
          S is a real or complex sparse matrix.

     TYP
          Is the type of the factorization and can be one of

          "sym" (default)
               Factorize S.  Assumes S is symmetric and uses the upper
               triangular portion of the matrix.

          "col"
               Factorize S’ * S.

          "row"
               Factorize S * S’.

          "lo"
               Factorize S’.  Assumes S is symmetric and uses the lower
               triangular portion of the matrix.

     MODE
          When MODE is unspecified return the Cholesky factorization for
          R.  If MODE is "lower" or "L" then return the conjugate
          transpose R’ which is a lower triangular factor.  The
          conjugate transpose version is faster and uses less memory,
          but still returns the same values for all other outputs:
          COUNT, H, PARENT, and POST.

     The output variables are:

     COUNT
          The row counts of the Cholesky factorization as determined by
          TYP.  The computational difficulty of performing the true
          factorization using ‘chol’ is ‘sum (COUNT .^ 2)’.

     H
          The height of the elimination tree.

     PARENT
          The elimination tree itself.

     POST
          A sparse boolean matrix whose structure is that of the
          Cholesky factorization as determined by TYP.

     See also: *note chol: XREFchol, *note etree: XREFetree, *note
     treelayout: XREFtreelayout.

   For non square matrices, the user can also utilize the ‘spaugment’
function to find a least squares solution to a linear equation.

 -- : S = spaugment (A, C)
     Create the augmented matrix of A.

     This is given by

          [C * eye(M, M), A;
                      A', zeros(N, N)]

     This is related to the least squares solution of ‘A \ B’, by

          S * [ R / C; x] = [ B, zeros(N, columns(B)) ]

     where R is the residual error

          R = B - A * X

     As the matrix S is symmetric indefinite it can be factorized with
     ‘lu’, and the minimum norm solution can therefore be found without
     the need for a ‘qr’ factorization.  As the residual error will be
     ‘zeros (M, M)’ for underdetermined problems, and example can be

          m = 11; n = 10; mn = max (m, n);
          A = spdiags ([ones(mn,1), 10*ones(mn,1), -ones(mn,1)],
                       [-1, 0, 1], m, n);
          x0 = A \ ones (m,1);
          s = spaugment (A);
          [L, U, P, Q] = lu (s);
          x1 = Q * (U \ (L \ (P  * [ones(m,1); zeros(n,1)])));
          x1 = x1(end - n + 1 : end);

     To find the solution of an overdetermined problem needs an estimate
     of the residual error R and so it is more complex to formulate a
     minimum norm solution using the ‘spaugment’ function.

     In general the left division operator is more stable and faster
     than using the ‘spaugment’ function.

     See also: *note mldivide: XREFmldivide.

   Finally, the function ‘eigs’ can be used to calculate a limited
number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors based on a selection criteria and
likewise for ‘svds’ which calculates a limited number of singular values
and vectors.

 -- : D = eigs (A)
 -- : D = eigs (A, K)
 -- : D = eigs (A, K, SIGMA)
 -- : D = eigs (A, K, SIGMA, OPTS)
 -- : D = eigs (A, B)
 -- : D = eigs (A, B, K)
 -- : D = eigs (A, B, K, SIGMA)
 -- : D = eigs (A, B, K, SIGMA, OPTS)
 -- : D = eigs (AF, N)
 -- : D = eigs (AF, N, K)
 -- : D = eigs (AF, N, K, SIGMA)
 -- : D = eigs (AF, N, K, SIGMA, OPTS)
 -- : D = eigs (AF, N, B)
 -- : D = eigs (AF, N, B, K)
 -- : D = eigs (AF, N, B, K, SIGMA)
 -- : D = eigs (AF, N, B, K, SIGMA, OPTS)
 -- : [V, D] = eigs (...)
 -- : [V, D, FLAG] = eigs (...)
     Calculate a limited number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors based on
     a selection criteria.

     By default, ‘eigs’ solve the equation ‘A * v = lambda * v’, where
     ‘lambda’ is a scalar representing one of the eigenvalues, and ‘v’
     is the corresponding eigenvector.  If given the positive definite
     matrix B then ‘eigs’ solves the general eigenvalue equation ‘A * v
     = lambda * B * v’.

     The input A is a square matrix of dimension N-by-N.  Typically, A
     is also large and sparse.

     The input B for the generalized eigenvalue problem is a square
     matrix with the same size as A (N-by-N).  Typically, B is also
     large and sparse.

     The number of eigenvalues and eigenvectors to calculate is given by
     K and defaults to 6.

     The argument SIGMA determines which eigenvalues are returned.
     SIGMA can be either a scalar or a string.  When SIGMA is a scalar,
     the K eigenvalues closest to SIGMA are returned.  If SIGMA is a
     string, it must be one of the following values.

     "lm"
          Largest Magnitude (default).

     "sm"
          Smallest Magnitude.

     "la"
          Largest Algebraic (valid only for real symmetric problems).

     "sa"
          Smallest Algebraic (valid only for real symmetric problems).

     "be"
          Both Ends, with one more from the high-end if K is odd (valid
          only for real symmetric problems).

     "lr"
          Largest Real part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric
          problems).

     "sr"
          Smallest Real part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric
          problems).

     "li"
          Largest Imaginary part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric
          problems).

     "si"
          Smallest Imaginary part (valid only for complex or unsymmetric
          problems).

     If OPTS is given, it is a structure defining possible options that
     ‘eigs’ should use.  The fields of the OPTS structure are:

     ‘issym’
          If AF is given then this flag (true/false) determines whether
          the function AF defines a symmetric problem.  It is ignored if
          a matrix A is given.  The default is false.

     ‘isreal’
          If AF is given then this flag (true/false) determines whether
          the function AF defines a real problem.  It is ignored if a
          matrix A is given.  The default is true.

     ‘tol’
          Defines the required convergence tolerance, calculated as ‘tol
          * norm (A)’.  The default is ‘eps’.

     ‘maxit’
          The maximum number of iterations.  The default is 300.

     ‘p’
          The number of Lanczos basis vectors to use.  More vectors will
          result in faster convergence, but a greater use of memory.
          The optimal value of ‘p’ is problem dependent and should be in
          the range ‘K + 1’ to N.  The default value is ‘2 * K’.

     ‘v0’
          The starting vector for the algorithm.  An initial vector
          close to the final vector will speed up convergence.  The
          default is for ARPACK to randomly generate a starting vector.
          If specified, ‘v0’ must be an N-by-1 vector where ‘N = rows
          (A)’.

     ‘disp’
          The level of diagnostic printout (0|1|2).  If ‘disp’ is 0 then
          diagnostics are disabled.  The default value is 0.

     ‘cholB’
          If the generalized eigenvalue problem is being calculated,
          this flag (true/false) specifies whether the B input
          represents ‘chol (B)’ or simply the matrix B.  The default is
          false.

     ‘permB’
          The permutation vector of the Cholesky factorization for B if
          ‘cholB’ is true.  It is obtained by ‘[R, ~, permB] = chol (B,
          "vector")’.  The default is ‘1:N’.

     It is also possible to represent A by a function denoted AF.  AF
     must be followed by a scalar argument N defining the length of the
     vector argument accepted by AF.  AF can be a function handle, an
     inline function, or a string.  When AF is a string it holds the
     name of the function to use.

     AF is a function of the form ‘y = Af (x)’ where the required return
     value of AF is determined by the value of SIGMA.  The four possible
     forms are

     ‘A * x’
          if SIGMA is not given or is a string other than "sm".

     ‘A \ x’
          if SIGMA is 0 or "sm".

     ‘(A - sigma * I) \ x’
          if SIGMA is a scalar not equal to 0; ‘I’ is the identity
          matrix of the same size as A.

     ‘(A - sigma * B) \ x’
          for the general eigenvalue problem.

     The return arguments and their form depend on the number of return
     arguments requested.  For a single return argument, a column vector
     D of length K is returned containing the K eigenvalues that have
     been found.  For two return arguments, V is an N-by-K matrix whose
     columns are the K eigenvectors corresponding to the returned
     eigenvalues.  The eigenvalues themselves are returned in D in the
     form of a K-by-K matrix, where the elements on the diagonal are the
     eigenvalues.

     The third return argument FLAG returns the status of the
     convergence.  If FLAG is 0 then all eigenvalues have converged.
     Any other value indicates a failure to converge.

     Programming Notes: For small problems, N < 500, consider using ‘eig
     (full (A))’.

     If ARPACK fails to converge consider increasing the number of
     Lanczos vectors (OPT.p), increasing the number of iterations
     (OPT.maxiter), or decreasing the tolerance (OPT.tol).

 -- : S = svds (A, K)
 -- : S = svds (A, K, SIGMA)

     Find a few singular values of the matrix A.

     The singular values are calculated using

          [M, N] = size (A);
          S = eigs ([sparse(M, M), A;
                               A', sparse(N, N)])

     The eigenvalues returned by ‘eigs’ correspond to the singular
     values of A.  The number of singular values to calculate is given
     by K and defaults to 6.

     The argument SIGMA specifies which singular values to find.  When
     SIGMA is the string ’L’, the default, the largest singular values
     of A are found.  Otherwise, SIGMA must be a real scalar and the
     singular values closest to SIGMA are found.  As a corollary, ‘SIGMA
     = 0’ finds the smallest singular values.  Note that for relatively
     small values of SIGMA, there is a chance that the requested number
     of singular values will not be found.  In that case SIGMA should be
     increased.

     OPTS is a structure defining options that ‘svds’ will pass to
     ‘eigs’.  The possible fields of this structure are documented in
     ‘eigs’.  By default, ‘svds’ sets the following three fields:

     ‘tol’
          The required convergence tolerance for the singular values.
          The default value is 1e-10.  ‘eigs’ is passed ‘TOL / sqrt
          (2)’.

     ‘maxit’
          The maximum number of iterations.  The default is 300.

     ‘disp’
          The level of diagnostic printout (0|1|2).  If ‘disp’ is 0 then
          diagnostics are disabled.  The default value is 0.

     If more than one output is requested then ‘svds’ will return an
     approximation of the singular value decomposition of A

          A_approx = U*S*V'

     where A_approx is a matrix of size A but only rank K.

     FLAG returns 0 if the algorithm has successfully converged, and 1
     otherwise.  The test for convergence is

          norm (A*V - U*S, 1) <= TOL * norm (A, 1)

     ‘svds’ is best for finding only a few singular values from a large
     sparse matrix.  Otherwise, ‘svd (full (A))’ will likely be more
     efficient.

22.3 Iterative Techniques Applied to Sparse Matrices
====================================================

The left division ‘\’ and right division ‘/’ operators, discussed in the
previous section, use direct solvers to resolve a linear equation of the
form ‘X = A \ B’ or ‘X = B / A’.  Octave also includes a number of
functions to solve sparse linear equations using iterative techniques.

 -- : X = pcg (A, B, TOL, MAXIT, M1, M2, X0, ...)
 -- : X = pcg (A, B, TOL, MAXIT, M, [], X0, ...)
 -- : [X, FLAG, RELRES, ITER, RESVEC, EIGEST] = pcg (A, B, ...)

     Solve the linear system of equations ‘A * X = B’ by means of the
     Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient iterative method.

     The input arguments are:

        • A is the matrix of the linear system and it must be square.  A
          can be passed as a matrix, function handle, or inline function
          ‘Afun’ such that ‘Afun(x) = A * x’.  Additional parameters to
          ‘Afun’ may be passed after X0.

          A has to be Hermitian and Positive Definite (HPD).  If ‘pcg’
          detects A not to be positive definite, a warning is printed
          and the FLAG output is set.

        • B is the right-hand side vector.

        • TOL is the required relative tolerance for the residual error,
          ‘B - A * X’.  The iteration stops if
          ‘norm (B - A * X)’ ≤ ‘TOL * norm (B)’.  If TOL is omitted or
          empty, then a tolerance of 1e-6 is used.

        • MAXIT is the maximum allowed number of iterations; if MAXIT is
          omitted or empty then a value of 20 is used.

        • M is a HPD preconditioning matrix.  For any decomposition ‘M =
          P1 * P2’ such that ‘inv (P1) * A * inv (P2)’ is HPD, the
          conjugate gradient method is formally applied to the linear
          system ‘inv (P1) * A * inv (P2) * Y = inv (P1) * B’, with ‘X =
          inv (P2) * Y’ (split preconditioning).  In practice, at each
          iteration of the conjugate gradient method a linear system
          with matrix M is solved with ‘mldivide’.  If a particular
          factorization ‘M = M1 * M2’ is available (for instance, an
          incomplete Cholesky factorization of A), the two matrices M1
          and M2 can be passed and the relative linear systems are
          solved with the ‘mldivide’ operator.  Note that a proper
          choice of the preconditioner may dramatically improve the
          overall performance of the method.  Instead of matrices M1 and
          M2, the user may pass two functions which return the results
          of applying the inverse of M1 and M2 to a vector.  If M1 is
          omitted or empty ‘[]’, then no preconditioning is applied.  If
          no factorization of M is available, M2 can be omitted or left
          [], and the input variable M1 can be used to pass the
          preconditioner M.

        • X0 is the initial guess.  If X0 is omitted or empty then the
          function sets X0 to a zero vector by default.

     The arguments which follow X0 are treated as parameters, and passed
     in an appropriate manner to any of the functions (A or M1 or M2)
     that have been given to ‘pcg’.  See the examples below for further
     details.

     The output arguments are:

        • X is the computed approximation to the solution of
          ‘A * X = B’.  If the algorithm did not converge, then X is the
          iteration which has the minimum residual.

        • FLAG reports on the convergence:

             • 0: The algorithm converged to within the prescribed
               tolerance.

             • 1: The algorithm did not converge and it reached the
               maximum number of iterations.

             • 2: The preconditioner matrix is singular.

             • 3: The algorithm stagnated, i.e., the absolute value of
               the difference between the current iteration X and the
               previous is less than ‘EPS * norm (X,2)’.

             • 4: The algorithm detects that the input (preconditioned)
               matrix is not HPD.

        • RELRES is the ratio of the final residual to its initial
          value, measured in the Euclidean norm.

        • ITER indicates the iteration of X which it was computed.
          Since the output X corresponds to the minimal residual
          solution, the total number of iterations that the method
          performed is given by ‘length(resvec) - 1’.

        • RESVEC describes the convergence history of the method.
          ‘RESVEC (I, 1)’ is the Euclidean norm of the residual, and
          ‘RESVEC (I, 2)’ is the preconditioned residual norm, after the
          (I-1)-th iteration, ‘I = 1, 2, ..., ITER+1’.  The
          preconditioned residual norm is defined as ‘R' * (M \ R)’
          where ‘R = B - A * X’, see also the description of M.  If
          EIGEST is not required, only ‘RESVEC (:, 1)’ is returned.

        • EIGEST returns the estimate for the smallest ‘EIGEST(1)’ and
          largest ‘EIGEST(2)’ eigenvalues of the preconditioned matrix
          ‘P = M \ A’.  In particular, if no preconditioning is used,
          the estimates for the extreme eigenvalues of A are returned.
          ‘EIGEST(1)’ is an overestimate and ‘EIGEST(2)’ is an
          underestimate, so that ‘EIGEST(2) / EIGEST(1)’ is a lower
          bound for ‘cond (P, 2)’, which nevertheless in the limit
          should theoretically be equal to the actual value of the
          condition number.

     Let us consider a trivial problem with a tridiagonal matrix

          n = 10;
          A = toeplitz (sparse ([1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], 1, n));
          b = A * ones (n, 1);
          M1 = ichol (A); # in this tridiagonal case it corresponds to chol (A)'
          M2 = M1';
          M = M1 * M2;
          Afun = @(x) A * x;
          Mfun = @(x) M \ x;
          M1fun = @(x) M1 \ x;
          M2fun = @(x) M2 \ x;

     EXAMPLE 1: Simplest use of ‘pcg’

          x = pcg (A, b)

     EXAMPLE 2: ‘pcg’ with a function which computes ‘A * X’

          x = pcg (Afun, b)

     EXAMPLE 3: ‘pcg’ with a preconditioner matrix M

          x = pcg (A, b, 1e-06, 100, M)

     EXAMPLE 4: ‘pcg’ with a function as preconditioner

          x = pcg (Afun, b, 1e-6, 100, Mfun)

     EXAMPLE 5: ‘pcg’ with preconditioner matrices M1 and M2

          x = pcg (A, b, 1e-6, 100, M1, M2)

     EXAMPLE 6: ‘pcg’ with functions as preconditioners

          x = pcg (Afun, b, 1e-6, 100, M1fun, M2fun)

     EXAMPLE 7: ‘pcg’ with as input a function requiring an argument

            function y = Ap (A, x, p) # compute A^p * x
               y = x;
               for i = 1:p
                 y = A * y;
               endfor
            endfunction
          Apfun = @(x, p) Ap (A, x, p);
          x = pcg (Apfun, b, [], [], [], [], [], 2);

     EXAMPLE 8: explicit example to show that ‘pcg’ uses a split
     preconditioner

          M1 = ichol (A + 0.1 * eye (n)); # factorization of A perturbed
          M2 = M1';
          M = M1 * M2;

          ## reference solution computed by pcg after two iterations
          [x_ref, fl] = pcg (A, b, [], 2, M)

          ## split preconditioning
          [y, fl] = pcg ((M1 \ A) / M2, M1 \ b, [], 2)
          x = M2 \ y # compare x and x_ref

 -- : X = pcr (A, B, TOL, MAXIT, M, X0, ...)
 -- : [X, FLAG, RELRES, ITER, RESVEC] = pcr (...)

     Solve the linear system of equations ‘A * X = B’ by means of the
     Preconditioned Conjugate Residuals iterative method.

     The input arguments are

        • A can be either a square (preferably sparse) matrix or a
          function handle, inline function or string containing the name
          of a function which computes ‘A * X’.  In principle A should
          be symmetric and non-singular; if ‘pcr’ finds A to be
          numerically singular, you will get a warning message and the
          FLAG output parameter will be set.

        • B is the right hand side vector.

        • TOL is the required relative tolerance for the residual error,
          ‘B - A * X’.  The iteration stops if ‘norm (B - A * X) <= TOL
          * norm (B - A * X0)’.  If TOL is empty or is omitted, the
          function sets ‘TOL = 1e-6’ by default.

        • MAXIT is the maximum allowable number of iterations; if ‘[]’
          is supplied for MAXIT, or ‘pcr’ has less arguments, a default
          value equal to 20 is used.

        • M is the (left) preconditioning matrix, so that the iteration
          is (theoretically) equivalent to solving by ‘pcr’ ‘P * X = M \
          B’, with ‘P = M \ A’.  Note that a proper choice of the
          preconditioner may dramatically improve the overall
          performance of the method.  Instead of matrix M, the user may
          pass a function which returns the results of applying the
          inverse of M to a vector (usually this is the preferred way of
          using the preconditioner).  If ‘[]’ is supplied for M, or M is
          omitted, no preconditioning is applied.

        • X0 is the initial guess.  If X0 is empty or omitted, the
          function sets X0 to a zero vector by default.

     The arguments which follow X0 are treated as parameters, and passed
     in a proper way to any of the functions (A or M) which are passed
     to ‘pcr’.  See the examples below for further details.

     The output arguments are

        • X is the computed approximation to the solution of ‘A * X =
          B’.

        • FLAG reports on the convergence.  ‘FLAG = 0’ means the
          solution converged and the tolerance criterion given by TOL is
          satisfied.  ‘FLAG = 1’ means that the MAXIT limit for the
          iteration count was reached.  ‘FLAG = 3’ reports a ‘pcr’
          breakdown, see [1] for details.

        • RELRES is the ratio of the final residual to its initial
          value, measured in the Euclidean norm.

        • ITER is the actual number of iterations performed.

        • RESVEC describes the convergence history of the method, so
          that ‘RESVEC (i)’ contains the Euclidean norms of the residual
          after the (I-1)-th iteration, ‘I = 1,2, ..., ITER+1’.

     Let us consider a trivial problem with a diagonal matrix (we
     exploit the sparsity of A)

          n = 10;
          A = sparse (diag (1:n));
          b = rand (N, 1);

     EXAMPLE 1: Simplest use of ‘pcr’

          x = pcr (A, b)

     EXAMPLE 2: ‘pcr’ with a function which computes ‘A * X’.

          function y = apply_a (x)
            y = [1:10]' .* x;
          endfunction

          x = pcr ("apply_a", b)

     EXAMPLE 3: Preconditioned iteration, with full diagnostics.  The
     preconditioner (quite strange, because even the original matrix A
     is trivial) is defined as a function

          function y = apply_m (x)
            k = floor (length (x) - 2);
            y = x;
            y(1:k) = x(1:k) ./ [1:k]';
          endfunction

          [x, flag, relres, iter, resvec] = ...
                             pcr (A, b, [], [], "apply_m")
          semilogy ([1:iter+1], resvec);

     EXAMPLE 4: Finally, a preconditioner which depends on a parameter
     K.

          function y = apply_m (x, varargin)
            k = varargin{1};
            y = x;
            y(1:k) = x(1:k) ./ [1:k]';
          endfunction

          [x, flag, relres, iter, resvec] = ...
                             pcr (A, b, [], [], "apply_m"', [], 3)

   The speed with which an iterative solver converges to a solution can
be accelerated with the use of a pre-conditioning matrix M.  In this
case the linear equation ‘M^-1 * X = M^-1 * A \ B’ is solved instead.
Typical pre-conditioning matrices are partial factorizations of the
original matrix.

 -- : L = ichol (A)
 -- : L = ichol (A, OPTS)

     Compute the incomplete Cholesky factorization of the sparse square
     matrix A.

     By default, ‘ichol’ uses only the lower triangle of A and produces
     a lower triangular factor L such that L*L’ approximates A.

     The factor given by this routine may be useful as a preconditioner
     for a system of linear equations being solved by iterative methods
     such as PCG (Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient).

     The factorization may be modified by passing options in a structure
     OPTS.  The option name is a field of the structure and the setting
     is the value of field.  Names and specifiers are case sensitive.

     type
          Type of factorization.

          "nofill" (default)
               Incomplete Cholesky factorization with no fill-in
               (IC(0)).

          "ict"
               Incomplete Cholesky factorization with threshold dropping
               (ICT).

     diagcomp
          A non-negative scalar ALPHA for incomplete Cholesky
          factorization of ‘A + ALPHA * diag (diag (A))’ instead of A.
          This can be useful when A is not positive definite.  The
          default value is 0.

     droptol
          A non-negative scalar specifying the drop tolerance for
          factorization if performing ICT.  The default value is 0 which
          produces the complete Cholesky factorization.

          Non-diagonal entries of L are set to 0 unless

          ‘abs (L(i,j)) >= droptol * norm (A(j:end, j), 1)’.

     michol
          Modified incomplete Cholesky factorization:

          "off" (default)
               Row and column sums are not necessarily preserved.

          "on"
               The diagonal of L is modified so that row (and column)
               sums are preserved even when elements have been dropped
               during the factorization.  The relationship preserved is:
               ‘A * e = L * L' * e’, where e is a vector of ones.

     shape

          "lower" (default)
               Use only the lower triangle of A and return a lower
               triangular factor L such that L*L’ approximates A.

          "upper"
               Use only the upper triangle of A and return an upper
               triangular factor U such that ‘U'*U’ approximates A.

     EXAMPLES

     The following problem demonstrates how to factorize a sample
     symmetric positive definite matrix with the full Cholesky
     decomposition and with the incomplete one.

          A = [ 0.37, -0.05,  -0.05,  -0.07;
               -0.05,  0.116,  0.0,   -0.05;
               -0.05,  0.0,    0.116, -0.05;
               -0.07, -0.05,  -0.05,   0.202];
          A = sparse (A);
          nnz (tril (A))
          ans =  9
          L = chol (A, "lower");
          nnz (L)
          ans =  10
          norm (A - L * L', "fro") / norm (A, "fro")
          ans =  1.1993e-16
          opts.type = "nofill";
          L = ichol (A, opts);
          nnz (L)
          ans =  9
          norm (A - L * L', "fro") / norm (A, "fro")
          ans =  0.019736

     Another example for decomposition is a finite difference matrix
     used to solve a boundary value problem on the unit square.

          nx = 400; ny = 200;
          hx = 1 / (nx + 1); hy = 1 / (ny + 1);
          Dxx = spdiags ([ones(nx, 1), -2*ones(nx, 1), ones(nx, 1)],
                         [-1 0 1 ], nx, nx) / (hx ^ 2);
          Dyy = spdiags ([ones(ny, 1), -2*ones(ny, 1), ones(ny, 1)],
                         [-1 0 1 ], ny, ny) / (hy ^ 2);
          A = -kron (Dxx, speye (ny)) - kron (speye (nx), Dyy);
          nnz (tril (A))

     Compute the incomplete LU factorization of the sparse square matrix
     A.

     ‘ilu’ returns a unit lower triangular matrix L, an upper triangular
     matrix U, and optionally a permutation matrix P, such that ‘L*U’
     approximates ‘P*A’.

     The factors given by this routine may be useful as preconditioners
     for a system of linear equations being solved by iterative methods
     such as BICG (BiConjugate Gradients) or GMRES (Generalized Minimum
     Residual Method).

     The factorization may be modified by passing options in a structure
     OPTS.  The option name is a field of the structure and the setting
     is the value of field.  Names and specifiers are case sensitive.

     ‘type’
          Type of factorization.

          "nofill" (default)
               ILU factorization with no fill-in (ILU(0)).

               Additional supported options: ‘milu’.

          "crout"
               Crout version of ILU factorization (ILUC).

               Additional supported options: ‘milu’, ‘droptol’.

          "ilutp"
               ILU factorization with threshold and pivoting.

               Additional supported options: ‘milu’, ‘droptol’, ‘udiag’,
               ‘thresh’.

     ‘droptol’
          A non-negative scalar specifying the drop tolerance for
          factorization.  The default value is 0 which produces the
          complete LU factorization.

          Non-diagonal entries of U are set to 0 unless

          ‘abs (U(i,j)) >= droptol * norm (A(:,j))’.

          Non-diagonal entries of L are set to 0 unless

          ‘abs (L(i,j)) >= droptol * norm (A(:,j))/U(j,j)’.

     ‘milu’
          Modified incomplete LU factorization:

          "row"
               Row-sum modified incomplete LU factorization.  The
               factorization preserves row sums: ‘A * e = L * U * e’,
               where e is a vector of ones.

          "col"
               Column-sum modified incomplete LU factorization.  The
               factorization preserves column sums: ‘e' * A = e' * L *
               U’.

          "off" (default)
               Row and column sums are not necessarily preserved.

     ‘udiag’
          If true, any zeros on the diagonal of the upper triangular
          factor are replaced by the local drop tolerance ‘droptol *
          norm (A(:,j))/U(j,j)’.  The default is false.

     ‘thresh’
          Pivot threshold for factorization.  It can range between 0
          (diagonal pivoting) and 1 (default), where the maximum
          magnitude entry in the column is chosen to be the pivot.

     If ‘ilu’ is called with just one output, the returned matrix is ‘L
     + U - speye (size (A))’, where L is unit lower triangular and U is
     upper triangular.

     With two outputs, ‘ilu’ returns a unit lower triangular matrix L
     and an upper triangular matrix U.  For OPTS.type == "ilutp", one of
     the factors is permuted based on the value of OPTS.milu.  When
     OPTS.milu == "row", U is a column permuted upper triangular factor.
     Otherwise, L is a row-permuted unit lower triangular factor.

     If there are three named outputs and OPTS.milu != "row", P is
     returned such that L and U are incomplete factors of ‘P*A’.  When
     OPTS.milu == "row", P is returned such that L and U are incomplete
     factors of ‘A*P’.

     EXAMPLES

          A = gallery ("neumann", 1600) + speye (1600);
          opts.type = "nofill";
          nnz (A)
          ans = 7840

          nnz (lu (A))
          ans = 126478

          nnz (ilu (A, opts))
          ans = 7840

     This shows that A has 7,840 nonzeros, the complete LU factorization
     has 126,478 nonzeros, and the incomplete LU factorization, with 0
     level of fill-in, has 7,840 nonzeros, the same amount as A.  Taken
     from: <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ilu.html>

          A = gallery ("wathen", 10, 10);
          b = sum (A, 2);
          tol = 1e-8;
          maxit = 50;
          opts.type = "crout";
          opts.droptol = 1e-4;
          [L, U] = ilu (A, opts);
          x = bicg (A, b, tol, maxit, L, U);
          norm (A * x - b, inf)

     This example uses ILU as preconditioner for a random FEM-Matrix,
     which has a large condition number.  Without L and U BICG would not
     converge.

22.4 Real Life Example using Sparse Matrices
============================================

A common application for sparse matrices is in the solution of Finite
Element Models.  Finite element models allow numerical solution of
partial differential equations that do not have closed form solutions,
typically because of the complex shape of the domain.

   In order to motivate this application, we consider the boundary value
Laplace equation.  This system can model scalar potential fields, such
as heat or electrical potential.  Given a medium Omega with boundary
dOmega.  At all points on the dOmega the boundary conditions are known,
and we wish to calculate the potential in Omega.  Boundary conditions
may specify the potential (Dirichlet boundary condition), its normal
derivative across the boundary (Neumann boundary condition), or a
weighted sum of the potential and its derivative (Cauchy boundary
condition).

   In a thermal model, we want to calculate the temperature in Omega and
know the boundary temperature (Dirichlet condition) or heat flux (from
which we can calculate the Neumann condition by dividing by the thermal
conductivity at the boundary).  Similarly, in an electrical model, we
want to calculate the voltage in Omega and know the boundary voltage
(Dirichlet) or current (Neumann condition after diving by the electrical
conductivity).  In an electrical model, it is common for much of the
boundary to be electrically isolated; this is a Neumann boundary
condition with the current equal to zero.

   The simplest finite element models will divide Omega into simplexes
(triangles in 2D, pyramids in 3D).

   The following example creates a simple rectangular 2-D electrically
conductive medium with 10 V and 20 V imposed on opposite sides
(Dirichlet boundary conditions).  All other edges are electrically
isolated.

        node_y = [1;1.2;1.5;1.8;2]*ones(1,11);
        node_x = ones(5,1)*[1,1.05,1.1,1.2, ...
                  1.3,1.5,1.7,1.8,1.9,1.95,2];
        nodes = [node_x(:), node_y(:)];

        [h,w] = size (node_x);
        elems = [];
        for idx = 1:w-1
          widx = (idx-1)*h;
          elems = [elems; ...
            widx+[(1:h-1);(2:h);h+(1:h-1)]'; ...
            widx+[(2:h);h+(2:h);h+(1:h-1)]' ];
        endfor

        E = size (elems,1); # No. of simplices
        N = size (nodes,1); # No. of vertices
        D = size (elems,2); # dimensions+1

   This creates a N-by-2 matrix ‘nodes’ and a E-by-3 matrix ‘elems’ with
values, which define finite element triangles:

       nodes(1:7,:)'
         1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.00 1.05 1.05 ...
         1.00 1.20 1.50 1.80 2.00 1.00 1.20 ...

       elems(1:7,:)'
         1    2    3    4    2    3    4 ...
         2    3    4    5    7    8    9 ...
         6    7    8    9    6    7    8 ...

   Using a first order FEM, we approximate the electrical conductivity
distribution in Omega as constant on each simplex (represented by the
vector ‘conductivity’).  Based on the finite element geometry, we first
calculate a system (or stiffness) matrix for each simplex (represented
as 3-by-3 elements on the diagonal of the element-wise system matrix
‘SE’).  Based on ‘SE’ and a N-by-DE connectivity matrix ‘C’,
representing the connections between simplices and vertices, the global
connectivity matrix ‘S’ is calculated.

       ## Element conductivity
       conductivity = [1*ones(1,16), ...
              2*ones(1,48), 1*ones(1,16)];

       ## Connectivity matrix
       C = sparse ((1:D*E), reshape (elems', ...
              D*E, 1), 1, D*E, N);

       ## Calculate system matrix
       Siidx = floor ([0:D*E-1]'/D) * D * ...
              ones(1,D) + ones(D*E,1)*(1:D) ;
       Sjidx = [1:D*E]'*ones (1,D);
       Sdata = zeros (D*E,D);
       dfact = factorial (D-1);
       for j = 1:E
          a = inv ([ones(D,1), ...
              nodes(elems(j,:), :)]);
          const = conductivity(j) * 2 / ...
              dfact / abs (det (a));
          Sdata(D*(j-1)+(1:D),:) = const * ...
              a(2:D,:)' * a(2:D,:);
       endfor
       ## Element-wise system matrix
       SE = sparse(Siidx,Sjidx,Sdata);
       ## Global system matrix
       S = C'* SE *C;

   The system matrix acts like the conductivity ‘S’ in Ohm’s law ‘S * V
= I’.  Based on the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, we are
able to solve for the voltages at each vertex ‘V’.

       ## Dirichlet boundary conditions
       D_nodes = [1:5, 51:55];
       D_value = [10*ones(1,5), 20*ones(1,5)];

       V = zeros (N,1);
       V(D_nodes) = D_value;
       idx = 1:N; # vertices without Dirichlet
                  # boundary condns
       idx(D_nodes) = [];

       ## Neumann boundary conditions.  Note that
       ## N_value must be normalized by the
       ## boundary length and element conductivity
       N_nodes = [];
       N_value = [];

       Q = zeros (N,1);
       Q(N_nodes) = N_value;

       V(idx) = S(idx,idx) \ ( Q(idx) - ...
                 S(idx,D_nodes) * V(D_nodes));

   Finally, in order to display the solution, we show each solved
voltage value in the z-axis for each simplex vertex.

       elemx = elems(:,[1,2,3,1])';
       xelems = reshape (nodes(elemx, 1), 4, E);
       yelems = reshape (nodes(elemx, 2), 4, E);
       velems = reshape (V(elemx), 4, E);
       plot3 (xelems,yelems,velems,"k");
       print "grid.eps";

23 Numerical Integration
************************

Octave comes with several built-in functions for computing the integral
of a function numerically (termed quadrature).  These functions all
solve 1-dimensional integration problems.

* Functions of One Variable::
* Orthogonal Collocation::
* Functions of Multiple Variables::


File: octave.info,  Node: Functions of One Variable,  Next: Orthogonal Collocation,  Up: Numerical Integration

23.1 Functions of One Variable
==============================

Octave supports five different adaptive quadrature algorithms for
computing the integral of a function f over the interval from a to b.
These are

‘quad’
     Numerical integration based on Gaussian quadrature.

‘quadv’
     Numerical integration using an adaptive vectorized Simpson’s rule.

‘quadl’
     Numerical integration using an adaptive Lobatto rule.

‘quadgk’
     Numerical integration using an adaptive Gauss-Konrod rule.

‘quadcc’
     Numerical integration using adaptive Clenshaw-Curtis rules.

     In addition, the following functions are also provided:

‘integral’
     A compatibility wrapper function that will choose between ‘quadv’
     and ‘quadgk’ depending on the integrand and options chosen.

‘trapz, cumtrapz’
     Numerical integration of data using the trapezoidal method.

The best quadrature algorithm to use depends on the integrand.  If you
have empirical data, rather than a function, the choice is ‘trapz’ or
‘cumtrapz’.  If you are uncertain about the characteristics of the
integrand, ‘quadcc’ will be the most robust as it can handle
discontinuities, singularities, oscillatory functions, and infinite
intervals.  When the integrand is smooth ‘quadgk’ may be the fastest of
the algorithms.

     Function    Characteristics
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     quad        Low accuracy with nonsmooth integrands
     quadv       Medium accuracy with smooth integrands
     quadl       Medium accuracy with smooth integrands.  Slower than
                 quadgk.
     quadgk      Medium accuracy (1e-6 – 1e-9) with smooth integrands.
                 Handles oscillatory functions and infinite bounds
     quadcc      Low to High accuracy with nonsmooth/smooth integrands
                 Handles oscillatory functions, singularities, and
                 infinite bounds

   Here is an example of using ‘quad’ to integrate the function

       F(X) = X * sin (1/X) * sqrt (abs (1 - X))

from X = 0 to X = 3.

   This is a fairly difficult integration (plot the function over the
range of integration to see why).

   The first step is to define the function:

     function y = f (x)
       y = x .* sin (1./x) .* sqrt (abs (1 - x));
     endfunction

   Note the use of the ‘dot’ forms of the operators.  This is not
necessary for the ‘quad’ integrator, but is required by the other
integrators.  In any case, it makes it much easier to generate a set of
points for plotting because it is possible to call the function with a
vector argument to produce a vector result.

   The second step is to call quad with the limits of integration:

     [q, ier, nfun, err] = quad ("f", 0, 3)
          ⇒ 1.9819
          ⇒ 1
          ⇒ 5061
          ⇒ 1.1522e-07

   Although ‘quad’ returns a nonzero value for IER, the result is
reasonably accurate (to see why, examine what happens to the result if
you move the lower bound to 0.1, then 0.01, then 0.001, etc.).

   The function "f" can be the string name of a function or a function
handle.  These options make it quite easy to do integration without
having to fully define a function in an m-file.  For example:

     # Verify gamma function = (n-1)! for n = 4
     f = @(x) x.^3 .* exp (-x);
     quadcc (f, 0, Inf)
          ⇒ 6.0000

 -- : Q = quad (F, A, B)
 -- : Q = quad (F, A, B, TOL)
 -- : Q = quad (F, A, B, TOL, SING)
 -- : [Q, IER, NFUN, ERR] = quad (...)
     Numerically evaluate the integral of F from A to B using Fortran
     routines from QUADPACK.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or a string containing the
     name of the function to evaluate.  The function must have the form
     ‘y = f (x)’ where Y and X are scalars.

     A and B are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Either or
     both may be infinite.

     The optional argument TOL is a vector that specifies the desired
     accuracy of the result.  The first element of the vector is the
     desired absolute tolerance, and the second element is the desired
     relative tolerance.  To choose a relative test only, set the
     absolute tolerance to zero.  To choose an absolute test only, set
     the relative tolerance to zero.  Both tolerances default to ‘sqrt
     (eps)’ or approximately 1.5e-8.

     The optional argument SING is a vector of values at which the
     integrand is known to be singular.

     The result of the integration is returned in Q.

     IER contains an integer error code (0 indicates a successful
     integration).

     NFUN indicates the number of function evaluations that were made.

     ERR contains an estimate of the error in the solution.

     The function ‘quad_options’ can set other optional parameters for
     ‘quad’.

     Note: because ‘quad’ is written in Fortran it cannot be called
     recursively.  This prevents its use in integrating over more than
     one variable by routines ‘dblquad’ and ‘triplequad’.

 -- : quad_options ()
 -- : val = quad_options (OPT)
 -- : quad_options (OPT, VAL)
     Query or set options for the function ‘quad’.

     When called with no arguments, the names of all available options
     and their current values are displayed.

     Given one argument, return the value of the option OPT.

     When called with two arguments, ‘quad_options’ sets the option OPT
     to value VAL.

     Options include

     "absolute tolerance"
          Absolute tolerance; may be zero for pure relative error test.

     "relative tolerance"
          Non-negative relative tolerance.  If the absolute tolerance is
          zero, the relative tolerance must be greater than or equal to
          ‘max (50*eps, 0.5e-28)’.

     "single precision absolute tolerance"
          Absolute tolerance for single precision; may be zero for pure
          relative error test.

     "single precision relative tolerance"
          Non-negative relative tolerance for single precision.  If the
          absolute tolerance is zero, the relative tolerance must be
          greater than or equal to ‘max (50*eps, 0.5e-28)’.

 -- : Q = quadv (F, A, B)
 -- : Q = quadv (F, A, B, TOL)
 -- : Q = quadv (F, A, B, TOL, TRACE)
 -- : Q = quadv (F, A, B, TOL, TRACE, P1, P2, ...)
 -- : [Q, NFUN] = quadv (...)

     Numerically evaluate the integral of F from A to B using an
     adaptive Simpson’s rule.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function to evaluate.  ‘quadv’ is a vectorized version
     of ‘quad’ and the function defined by F must accept a scalar or
     vector as input and return a scalar, vector, or array as output.

     A and B are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Both limits
     must be finite.

     The optional argument TOL defines the absolute tolerance used to
     stop the adaptation procedure.  The default value is 1e-6.

     The algorithm used by ‘quadv’ involves recursively subdividing the
     integration interval and applying Simpson’s rule on each
     subinterval.  If TRACE is true then after computing each of these
     partial integrals display: (1) the total number of function
     evaluations, (2) the left end of the subinterval, (3) the length of
     the subinterval, (4) the approximation of the integral over the
     subinterval.

     Additional arguments P1, etc., are passed directly to the function
     F.  To use default values for TOL and TRACE, one may pass empty
     matrices ([]).

     The result of the integration is returned in Q.

     The optional output NFUN indicates the total number of function
     evaluations performed.

     Note: ‘quadv’ is written in Octave’s scripting language and can be
     used recursively in ‘dblquad’ and ‘triplequad’, unlike the ‘quad’
     function.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the

     Numerically evaluate the integral of F from A to B using adaptive
     Gauss-Kronrod quadrature.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must be
     vectorized and return a vector of output values when given a vector
     of input values.

     A and B are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Either or
     both limits may be infinite or contain weak end singularities.
     Variable transformation will be used to treat any infinite
     intervals and weaken the singularities.  For example:

          quadgk (@(x) 1 ./ (sqrt (x) .* (x + 1)), 0, Inf)

     Note that the formulation of the integrand uses the
     element-by-element operator ‘./’ and all user functions to ‘quadgk’
     should do the same.

     The optional argument TOL defines the absolute tolerance used to
     stop the integration procedure.  The default value is 1e-10 (1e-5
     for single).

     The algorithm used by ‘quadgk’ involves subdividing the integration
     interval and evaluating each subinterval.  If TRACE is true then
     after computing each of these partial integrals display: (1) the
     number of subintervals at this step, (2) the current estimate of
     the error ERR, (3) the current estimate for the integral Q.

     The behavior of the algorithm can be configured by passing
     arguments to ‘quadgk’ as pairs "PROP", VAL.  Valid properties are

     ‘AbsTol’
          Define the absolute error tolerance for the quadrature.  The
          default absolute tolerance is 1e-10 (1e-5 for single).

     ‘RelTol’
          Define the relative error tolerance for the quadrature.  The
          default relative tolerance is 1e-6 (1e-4 for single).

     ‘MaxIntervalCount’
          ‘quadgk’ initially subdivides the interval on which to perform
          the quadrature into 10 intervals.  Subintervals that have an
          unacceptable error are subdivided and re-evaluated.  If the
          number of subintervals exceeds 650 subintervals at any point
          then a poor convergence is signaled and the current estimate
          of the integral is returned.  The property "MaxIntervalCount"
          can be used to alter the number of subintervals that can exist
          before exiting.

     ‘WayPoints’
          Discontinuities in the first derivative of the function to
          integrate can be flagged with the "WayPoints" property.  This
          forces the ends of a subinterval to fall on the breakpoints of
          the function and can result in significantly improved
          estimation of the error in the integral, faster computation,
          or both.  For example,

               quadgk (@(x) abs (1 - x.^2), 0, 2, "Waypoints", 1)

          signals the breakpoint in the integrand at ‘X = 1’.

     ‘Trace’
          If logically true ‘quadgk’ prints information on the
          convergence of the quadrature at each iteration.

     If any of A, B, or WAYPOINTS is complex then the quadrature is
     treated as a contour integral along a piecewise continuous path
     defined by ‘[A, WAYPOINTS(1), WAYPOINTS(2), ..., B]’.  In this case
     the integral is assumed to have no edge singularities.  For
     example,

          quadgk (@(z) log (z), 1+1i, 1+1i, "WayPoints",
                  [-1+1i, -1-1i, +1-1i])

     integrates ‘log (z)’ along the square defined by ‘[1+1i, -1+1i,
     -1-1i, +1-1i]’.

     The result of the integration is returned in Q.

     ERR is an approximate bound on the error in the integral
     ‘abs (Q - I)’, where I is the exact value of the integral.

 -- : Q = quadcc (F, A, B, TOL)
 -- : Q = quadcc (F, A, B, TOL, SING)
 -- : [Q, ERR, NR_POINTS] = quadcc (...)
     Numerically evaluate the integral of F from A to B using
     doubly-adaptive Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must be
     vectorized and must return a vector of output values if given a
     vector of input values.  For example,

          f = @(x) x .* sin (1./x) .* sqrt (abs (1 - x));

     which uses the element-by-element “dot” form for all operators.

     A and B are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Either or
     both limits may be infinite.  ‘quadcc’ handles an infinite limit by
     substituting the variable of integration with ‘x = tan (pi/2*u)’.

     The optional argument TOL is a 1- or 2-element vector that
     specifies the desired accuracy of the result.  The first element of
     the vector is the desired absolute tolerance, and the second
     element is the desired relative tolerance.  To choose a relative
     test only, set the absolute tolerance to zero.  To choose an
     absolute test only, set the relative tolerance to zero.  The
     default absolute tolerance is 1e-10 (1e-5 for single), and the
     default relative tolerance is 1e-6 (1e-4 for single).

     The optional argument SING contains a list of points where the
     integrand has known singularities, or discontinuities in any of its
     derivatives, inside the integration interval.  For the example
     above, which has a discontinuity at x=1, the call to ‘quadcc’ would
     be as follows

          int = quadcc (f, a, b, [], [ 1 ]);

     The result of the integration is returned in Q.

     ERR is an estimate of the absolute integration error.

     NR_POINTS is the number of points at which the integrand was
     evaluated.

     If the adaptive integration did not converge, the value of ERR will
     be larger than the requested tolerance.  Therefore, it is
     recommended to verify this value for difficult integrands.

     ‘quadcc’ is capable of dealing with non-numeric values of the
     integrand such as ‘NaN’ or ‘Inf’.  If the integral diverges, and
     ‘quadcc’ detects this, then a warning is issued and ‘Inf’ or ‘-Inf’
     is returned.

     Note: ‘quadcc’ is a general purpose quadrature algorithm and, as
     such, may be less efficient for a smooth or otherwise well-behaved
     integrand than other methods such as ‘quadgk’.

     The algorithm uses Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature rules of increasing
     degree in each interval and bisects the interval if either the
     function does not appear to be smooth or a rule of maximum degree
     has been reached.  The error estimate is computed from the L2-norm
     of the difference between two successive interpolations of the
     integrand over the nodes of the respective quadrature rules.

 -- : Q = integral (F, A, B)
 -- : Q = integral (F, A, B, PROP, VAL, ...)

     Numerically evaluate the integral of F from A to B using adaptive
     quadrature.

     ‘integral’ is a wrapper for ‘quadcc’ (general real-valued, scalar
     integrands and limits), ‘quadgk’ (integrals with specified
     integration paths), and ‘quadv’ (array-valued integrands) that is
     intended to provide MATLAB compatibility.  More control of the
     numerical integration may be achievable by calling the various
     quadrature functions directly.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must be
     vectorized and return a vector of output values when given a vector
     of input values.

     A and B are the lower and upper limits of integration.  Either or
     both limits may be infinite or contain weak end singularities.  If
     either or both limits are complex, ‘integral’ will perform a
     straight line path integral.  Alternatively, a complex domain path
     can be specified using the "Waypoints" option (see below).

     Additional optional parameters can be specified using "PROPERTY",
     VALUE pairs.  Valid properties are:

     ‘Waypoints’
          Specifies points to be used in defining subintervals of the
          quadrature algorithm, or if A, B, or WAYPOINTS are complex
          then the quadrature is calculated as a contour integral along
          a piecewise continuous path.  For more detail, *note ‘quadgk’:
          XREFquadgk.

     ‘ArrayValued’
          ‘integral’ expects F to return a scalar value unless
          ARRAYVALUED is specified as true.  This option will cause
          ‘integral’ to perform the integration over the entire array
          and return Q with the same dimensions as returned by F.  For
          more detail *note ‘quadv’: XREFquadv.

     ‘AbsTol’
          Define the absolute error tolerance for the quadrature.  The
          default absolute tolerance is 1e-10 (1e-5 for single).

     ‘RelTol’
          Define the relative error tolerance for the quadrature.  The
          default relative tolerance is 1e-6 (1e-4 for single).

     Adaptive quadrature is used to minimize the estimate of error until
     the following is satisfied:

            ERROR <= max (ABSTOL, RELTOL*|Q|).

     Known MATLAB incompatibilities:

       1. If tolerances are left unspecified, and any integration limits
          or waypoints are of type ‘single’, then Octave’s integral
          functions automatically reduce the default absolute and
          relative error tolerances as specified above.  If tighter
          tolerances are desired they must be specified.  MATLAB leaves
          the tighter tolerances appropriate for ‘double’ inputs in
          place regardless of the class of the integration limits.

       2. As a consequence of using ‘quadcc’, ‘quadgk’, and ‘quadv’,
          certain option combinations are not supported.  Currently,
          "ArrayValued" cannot be combined with "RelTol" or "Waypoints".

   Sometimes one does not have the function, but only the raw (x, y)
points from which to perform an integration.  This can occur when
collecting data in an experiment.  The ‘trapz’ function can integrate
these values as shown in the following example where "data" has been
collected on the cosine function over the range [0, pi/2).

     x = 0:0.1:pi/2;  # Uniformly spaced points
     y = cos (x);
     trapz (x, y)
          ⇒ 0.99666

   The answer is reasonably close to the exact value of 1.  Ordinary
quadrature is sensitive to the characteristics of the integrand.
Empirical integration depends not just on the integrand, but also on the
particular points chosen to represent the function.  Repeating the
example above with the sine function over the range [0, pi/2) produces
far inferior results.

     x = 0:0.1:pi/2;  # Uniformly spaced points
     y = sin (x);
     trapz (x, y)
          ⇒ 0.92849

   However, a slightly different choice of data points can change the
result significantly.  The same integration, with the same number of
points, but spaced differently produces a more accurate answer.

     x = linspace (0, pi/2, 16);  # Uniformly spaced, but including endpoint
     y = sin (x);
     trapz (x, y)
          ⇒ 0.99909

   In general there may be no way of knowing the best distribution of
points ahead of time.  Or the points may come from an experiment where
there is no freedom to select the best distribution.  In any case, one
must remain aware of this issue when using ‘trapz’.

 -- : Q = trapz (Y)
 -- : Q = trapz (X, Y)
 -- : Q = trapz (..., DIM)

     Numerically evaluate the integral of points Y using the trapezoidal
     method.

     ‘trapz (Y)’ computes the integral of Y along the first
     non-singleton dimension.  When the argument X is omitted an equally
     spaced X vector with unit spacing (1) is assumed.  ‘trapz (X, Y)’
     evaluates the integral with respect to the spacing in X and the
     values in Y.  This is useful if the points in Y have been sampled
     unevenly.

     If the optional DIM argument is given, operate along this
     dimension.

     Application Note: If X is not specified then unit spacing will be
     used.  To scale the integral to the correct value you must multiply
     by the actual spacing value (deltaX). As an example, the integral
     of x^3 over the range [0, 1] is x^4/4 or 0.25.  The following code
     uses ‘trapz’ to calculate the integral in three different ways.

          x = 0:0.1:1;
          y = x.^3;
          ## No scaling
          q = trapz (y)
            ⇒ q = 2.5250
          ## Approximation to integral by scaling
          q * 0.1
            ⇒ 0.25250
          ## Same result by specifying X
          trapz (x, y)
            ⇒ 0.25250

     See also: *note cumtrapz: XREFcumtrapz.

 -- : Q = cumtrapz (Y)
 -- : Q = cumtrapz (X, Y)
 -- : Q = cumtrapz (..., DIM)
     Cumulative numerical integration of points Y using the trapezoidal
     method.

     ‘cumtrapz (Y)’ computes the cumulative integral of Y along the
     first non-singleton dimension.  Where ‘trapz’ reports only the
     overall integral sum, ‘cumtrapz’ reports the current partial sum
     value at each point of Y.

     When the argument X is omitted an equally spaced X vector with unit
     spacing (1) is assumed.  ‘cumtrapz (X, Y)’ evaluates the integral
     with respect to the spacing in X and the values in Y.  This is
     useful if the points in Y have been sampled unevenly.

     If the optional DIM argument is given, operate along this
     dimension.

     Application Note: If X is not specified then unit spacing will be
     used.  To scale the integral to the correct value you must multiply
     by the actual spacing value (deltaX).

23.2 Orthogonal Collocation
===========================

 -- : [R, AMAT, BMAT, Q] = colloc (N, "left", "right")
     Compute derivative and integral weight matrices for orthogonal
     collocation.

     Reference: J. Villadsen, M. L. Michelsen, ‘Solution of Differential
     Equation Models by Polynomial Approximation’.

   Here is an example of using ‘colloc’ to generate weight matrices for
solving the second order differential equation U’ - ALPHA * U” = 0 with
the boundary conditions U(0) = 0 and U(1) = 1.

   First, we can generate the weight matrices for N points (including
the endpoints of the interval), and incorporate the boundary conditions
in the right hand side (for a specific value of ALPHA).

     n = 7;
     alpha = 0.1;
     [r, a, b] = colloc (n-2, "left", "right");
     at = a(2:n-1,2:n-1);
     bt = b(2:n-1,2:n-1);
     rhs = alpha * b(2:n-1,n) - a(2:n-1,n);

   Then the solution at the roots R is

     u = [ 0; (at - alpha * bt) \ rhs; 1]
          ⇒ [ 0.00; 0.004; 0.01 0.00; 0.12; 0.62; 1.00 ]

23.3 Functions of Multiple Variables
====================================

Octave includes several functions for computing the integral of
functions of multiple variables.  This procedure can generally be
performed by creating a function that integrates f with respect to x,
and then integrates that function with respect to y.  This procedure can
be performed manually using the following example which integrates the
function:

     f(x, y) = sin(pi*x*y) * sqrt(x*y)

   for x and y between 0 and 1.

   Using ‘quadgk’ in the example below, a double integration can be
performed.  (Note that any of the 1-D quadrature functions can be used
in this fashion except for ‘quad’ since it is written in Fortran and
cannot be called recursively.)

     function q = g(y)
       q = ones (size (y));
       for i = 1:length (y)
         f = @(x) sin (pi*x.*y(i)) .* sqrt (x.*y(i));
         q(i) = quadgk (f, 0, 1);
       endfor
     endfunction

     I = quadgk ("g", 0, 1)
           ⇒ 0.30022

   The algorithm above is implemented in the function ‘dblquad’ for
integrals over two variables.  The 3-D equivalent of this process is
implemented in ‘triplequad’ for integrals over three variables.  As an
example, the result above can be replicated with a call to ‘dblquad’ as
shown below.

     I = dblquad (@(x, y) sin (pi*x.*y) .* sqrt (x.*y), 0, 1, 0, 1)
           ⇒ 0.30022

 -- : dblquad (F, XA, XB, YA, YB)
 -- : dblquad (F, XA, XB, YA, YB, TOL)
 -- : dblquad (F, XA, XB, YA, YB, TOL, QUADF)
 -- : dblquad (F, XA, XB, YA, YB, TOL, QUADF, ...)
     Numerically evaluate the double integral of F.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must have the
     form z = f(x,y) where X is a vector and Y is a scalar.  It should
     return a vector of the same length and orientation as X.

     XA, YA and XB, YB are the lower and upper limits of integration for
     x and y respectively.  The underlying integrator determines whether
     infinite bounds are accepted.

     The optional argument TOL defines the absolute tolerance used to
     integrate each sub-integral.  The default value is 1e-6.

     The optional argument QUADF specifies which underlying integrator
     function to use.  Any choice but ‘quad’ is available and the
     default is ‘quadcc’.

     Additional arguments, are passed directly to F.  To use the default
     value for TOL or QUADF one may pass ’:’ or an empty matrix ([]).

     Numerically evaluate the triple integral of F.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must have the
     form w = f(x,y,z) where either X or Y is a vector and the remaining
     inputs are scalars.  It should return a vector of the same length
     and orientation as X or Y.

     XA, YA, ZA and XB, YB, ZB are the lower and upper limits of
     integration for x, y, and z respectively.  The underlying

     The optional argument QUADF specifies which underlying integrator
     function to use.  Any choice but ‘quad’ is available and the
     default is ‘quadcc’.

     Additional arguments, are passed directly to F.  To use the default

   The recursive algorithm for quadrature presented above is referred to
as "iterated".  A separate 2-D integration method is implemented in the
function ‘quad2d’.  This function performs a "tiled" integration by
subdividing the integration domain into rectangular regions and
performing separate integrations over those domains.  The domains are
further subdivided in areas requiring refinement to reach the desired
numerical accuracy.  For certain functions this method can be faster
than the 2-D iteration used in the other functions above.

 -- : Q = quad2d (F, XA, XB, YA, YB)
 -- : Q = quad2d (F, XA, XB, YA, YB, PROP, VAL, ...)
 -- : [Q, ERR, ITER] = quad2d (...)

     Numerically evaluate the two-dimensional integral of F using
     adaptive quadrature over the two-dimensional domain defined by XA,
     XB, YA, YB using tiled integration.  Additionally, YA and YB may be
     scalar functions of X, allowing for the integration over
     non-rectangular domains.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must be of the
     form z = f(x,y) where X is a vector and Y is a scalar.  It should
     return a vector of the same length and orientation as X.

     Additional optional parameters can be specified using "PROPERTY",
     VALUE pairs.  Valid properties are:

     ‘AbsTol’
          Define the absolute error tolerance for the quadrature.  The
          default value is 1e-10 (1e-5 for single).

     ‘RelTol’
          Define the relative error tolerance for the quadrature.  The
          default value is 1e-6 (1e-4 for single).

     ‘MaxFunEvals’
          The maximum number of function calls to the vectorized
          function F.  The default value is 5000.

     ‘Singular’
          Enable/disable transforms to weaken singularities on the edge
          of the integration domain.  The default value is TRUE.

     ‘Vectorized’
          Option to disable vectorized integration, forcing Octave to
          use only scalar inputs when calling the integrand.  The
          default value is FALSE.

     ‘FailurePlot’
          If ‘quad2d’ fails to converge to the desired error tolerance
          before MaxFunEvals is reached, a plot of the areas that still
          need refinement is created.  The default value is FALSE.

     Adaptive quadrature is used to minimize the estimate of error until
     the following is satisfied:

                  ERROR <= max (ABSTOL, RELTOL*|Q|)

     The optional output ERR is an approximate bound on the error in the
     integral ‘abs (Q - I)’, where I is the exact value of the integral.
     The optional output ITER is the number of vectorized function calls
     to the function F that were used.

     Example 1 : integrate a rectangular region in x-y plane

          F = @(X,Y) 2*ones (size (X));
          Q = quad2d (F, 0, 1, 0, 1)
            ⇒ Q =  2

     The result is a volume, which for this constant-value integrand, is
     just ‘LENGTH * WIDTH * HEIGHT’.

     Example 2 : integrate a triangular region in x-y plane

          F = @(X,Y) 2*ones (size (X));
          YMAX = @(X) 1 - X;
          Q = quad2d (F, 0, 1, 0, YMAX)
            ⇒ Q =  1

     The result is a volume, which for this constant-value integrand, is
     the Triangle Area x Height or ‘1/2 * BASE * WIDTH * HEIGHT’.

     Programming Notes: If there are singularities within the
     integration region it is best to split the integral and place the
     singularities on the boundary.

     Known MATLAB incompatibility: If tolerances are left unspecified,
     and any integration limits are of type ‘single’, then Octave’s
     integral functions automatically reduce the default absolute and
     relative error tolerances as specified above.  If tighter
     tolerances are desired they must be specified.  MATLAB leaves the
     tighter tolerances appropriate for ‘double’ inputs in place
     regardless of the class of the integration limits.

   Finally, the functions ‘integral2’ and ‘integral3’ are provided as
general 2-D and 3-D integration functions.  They will auto-select
between iterated and tiled integration methods and, unlike ‘dblquad’ and
‘triplequad’, will work with non-rectangular integration domains.

 -- : Q = integral2 (F, XA, XB, YA, YB)
 -- : Q = integral2 (F, XA, XB, YA, YB, PROP, VAL, ...)
 -- : [Q, ERR] = integral2 (...)

     Numerically evaluate the two-dimensional integral of F using
     adaptive quadrature over the two-dimensional domain defined by XA,
     XB, YA, YB (scalars may be finite or infinite).  Additionally, YA
     and YB may be scalar functions of X, allowing for integration over
     non-rectangular domains.

     F is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function to evaluate.  The function F must be of the
     form z = f(x,y) where X is a vector and Y is a scalar.  It should
     return a vector of the same length and orientation as X.

     Additional optional parameters can be specified using "PROPERTY",
     VALUE pairs.  Valid properties are:

     ‘AbsTol’
          Define the absolute error tolerance for the quadrature.  The
          default value is 1e-10 (1e-5 for single).

     ‘RelTol’
          Define the relative error tolerance for the quadrature.  The
          default value is 1e-6 (1e-4 for single).

     ‘Method’
          Specify the two-dimensional integration method to be used,
          with valid options being "auto" (default), "tiled", or
          "iterated".  When using "auto", Octave will choose the "tiled"
          method unless any of the integration limits are infinite.

     ‘Vectorized’
          Enable or disable vectorized integration.  A value of ‘false’
          forces Octave to use only scalar inputs when calling the
          integrand, which enables integrands f(x,y) that have not been
          vectorized and only accept X and Y as scalars to be used.  The
          default value is ‘true’.

     Adaptive quadrature is used to minimize the estimate of error until
     the following is satisfied:

                  ERROR <= max (ABSTOL, RELTOL*|Q|)

     ERR is an approximate bound on the error in the integral ‘abs (Q -
     I)’, where I is the exact value of the integral.

     Example 1 : integrate a rectangular region in x-y plane

          F = @(X,Y) 2*ones (size (X));
          Q = integral2 (F, 0, 1, 0, 1)
            ⇒ Q =  2

     The result is a volume, which for this constant-value integrand, is
     just ‘LENGTH * WIDTH * HEIGHT’.

     Example 2 : integrate a triangular region in x-y plane

          F = @(X,Y) 2*ones (size (X));
          YMAX = @(X) 1 - X;
          Q = integral2 (F, 0, 1, 0, YMAX)
            ⇒ Q =  1

     The result is a volume, which for this constant-value integrand, is
     the Triangle Area x Height or ‘1/2 * BASE * WIDTH * HEIGHT’.

     Numerically evaluate the three-dimensional integral of F using
     adaptive quadrature over the three-dimensional domain defined by
     XA, XB, YA, YB, ZA, ZB (scalars may be finite or infinite).
     Additionally, YA and YB may be scalar functions of X and ZA, and ZB

     I)’, where I is the exact value of the integral.

     Example 1 : integrate over a rectangular volume

          F = @(X,Y,Z) ones (size (X));
          Q = integral3 (F, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1)
            ⇒ Q =  1.00000

     For this constant-value integrand, the result is a volume which is
     just ‘LENGTH * WIDTH * HEIGHT’.

     Example 2 : integrate over a spherical volume

          F = @(X,Y) ones (size (X));
          YMAX = @(X) sqrt (1 - X.^2);
          ZMAX = @(X,Y) sqrt (1 - X.^2 - Y.^2);
          Q = integral3 (F, 0, 1, 0, YMAX, 0, ZMAX)
            ⇒ Q =  0.52360

     For this constant-value integrand, the result is a volume which is
     1/8th of a unit sphere or ‘1/8 * 4/3 * pi’.

     Programming Notes: If there are singularities within the
     integration region it is best to split the integral and place the

   The above integrations can be fairly slow, and that problem increases
exponentially with the dimensionality of the integral.  Another possible
solution for 2-D integration is to use Orthogonal Collocation as
described in the previous section (*note Orthogonal Collocation::).  The
integral of a function f(x,y) for x and y between 0 and 1 can be
approximated using n points by the sum over ‘i=1:n’ and ‘j=1:n’ of
‘q(i)*q(j)*f(r(i),r(j))’, where q and r is as returned by ‘colloc (n)’.
The generalization to more than two variables is straight forward.  The
following code computes the studied integral using n=8 points.

     f = @(x,y) sin (pi*x*y') .* sqrt (x*y');
     n = 8;
     [t, ~, ~, q] = colloc (n);
     I = q'*f(t,t)*q;
           ⇒ 0.30022

It should be noted that the number of points determines the quality of
the approximation.  If the integration needs to be performed between a
and b, instead of 0 and 1, then a change of variables is needed.

24.1 Ordinary Differential Equations
====================================

The function ‘lsode’ can be used to solve ODEs of the form

     dx
     -- = f (x, t)
     dt

using Hindmarsh’s ODE solver LSODE.

 -- : [X, ISTATE, MSG] = lsode (FCN, X_0, T)
 -- : [X, ISTATE, MSG] = lsode (FCN, X_0, T, T_CRIT)
     Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver.

     The set of differential equations to solve is

          dx
          -- = f (x, t)
          dt

     with

          x(t_0) = x_0

     The solution is returned in the matrix X, with each row
     corresponding to an element of the vector T.  The first element of
     T should be t_0 and should correspond to the initial state of the
     system X_0, so that the first row of the output is X_0.

     The first argument, FCN, is a string, inline, or function handle
     that names the function f to call to compute the vector of right
     hand sides for the set of equations.  The function must have the
     form

          XDOT = f (X, T)

     in which XDOT and X are vectors and T is a scalar.

     If FCN is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array of
     strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element
     names the function f described above, and the second element names
     a function to compute the Jacobian of f.  The Jacobian function
     must have the form

          JAC = j (X, T)

     in which JAC is the matrix of partial derivatives

                       | df_1  df_1       df_1 |
                       | ----  ----  ...  ---- |
                       | dx_1  dx_2       dx_N |
                       |                       |
                       | df_2  df_2       df_2 |
                       | ----  ----  ...  ---- |
                df_i   | dx_1  dx_2       dx_N |
          jac = ---- = |                       |
                dx_j   |  .    .     .    .    |
                       |  .    .      .   .    |
                       |  .    .       .  .    |
                       |                       |
                       | df_N  df_N       df_N |
                       | ----  ----  ...  ---- |
                       | dx_1  dx_2       dx_N |

     The second argument specifies the initial state of the system x_0.
     The third argument is a vector, T, specifying the time values for
     which a solution is sought.

     The fourth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set
     of times that the ODE solver should not integrate past.  It is
     useful for avoiding difficulties with singularities and points
     where there is a discontinuity in the derivative.

     After a successful computation, the value of ISTATE will be 2
     (consistent with the Fortran version of LSODE).

     If the computation is not successful, ISTATE will be something
     other than 2 and MSG will contain additional information.

     You can use the function ‘lsode_options’ to set optional parameters
     for ‘lsode’.

     See Alan C. Hindmarsh, ‘ODEPACK, A Systematized Collection of ODE
     Solvers’, in Scientific Computing, R. S. Stepleman, editor, (1983)
     or <https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/odepack> for more
     information about the inner workings of ‘lsode’.

     Example: Solve the Van der Pol equation

          fvdp = @(Y,T) [Y(2); (1 - Y(1)^2) * Y(2) - Y(1)];
          T = linspace (0, 20, 100);
          Y = lsode (fvdp, [2; 0], T);

     dasrt: XREFdasrt.

 -- : lsode_options ()
 -- : val = lsode_options (OPT)
 -- : lsode_options (OPT, VAL)
     Query or set options for the function ‘lsode’.

     When called with no arguments, the names of all available options
     and their current values are displayed.

     Given one argument, return the value of the option OPT.

     When called with two arguments, ‘lsode_options’ sets the option OPT
     to value VAL.

     Options include

     "absolute tolerance"
          Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a
          vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector.

     "relative tolerance"
          Relative tolerance parameter.  Unlike the absolute tolerance,
          this parameter may only be a scalar.

          The local error test applied at each integration step is

                 abs (local error in x(i)) <= ...
                     rtol * abs (y(i)) + atol(i)

     "integration method"
          A string specifying the method of integration to use to solve
          the ODE system.  Valid values are

          "adams"
          "non-stiff"
               No Jacobian used (even if it is available).

          "bdf"
          "stiff"
               Use stiff backward differentiation formula (BDF) method.
               If a function to compute the Jacobian is not supplied,
               ‘lsode’ will compute a finite difference approximation of
               the Jacobian matrix.

     "initial step size"
          The step size to be attempted on the first step (default is
          determined automatically).

     "maximum order"
          Restrict the maximum order of the solution method.  If using
          the Adams method, this option must be between 1 and 12.
          Otherwise, it must be between 1 and 5, inclusive.

     "maximum step size"
          Setting the maximum stepsize will avoid passing over very
          large regions (default is not specified).

     "minimum step size"
          The minimum absolute step size allowed (default is 0).

     "step limit"
          Maximum number of steps allowed (default is 100000).

   Here is an example of solving a set of three differential equations
using ‘lsode’.  Given the function

     ## oregonator differential equation
     function xdot = f (x, t)

       xdot = zeros (3,1);

       xdot(1) = 77.27 * (x(2) - x(1)*x(2) + x(1) ...
                 - 8.375e-06*x(1)^2);
       xdot(2) = (x(3) - x(1)*x(2) - x(2)) / 77.27;
       xdot(3) = 0.161*(x(1) - x(3));

     endfunction

and the initial condition ‘x0 = [ 4; 1.1; 4 ]’, the set of equations can
be integrated using the command

     t = linspace (0, 500, 1000);

     y = lsode ("f", x0, t);

   If you try this, you will see that the value of the result changes
dramatically between T = 0 and 5, and again around T = 305.  A more
efficient set of output points might be

     t = [0, logspace(-1, log10(303), 150), ...
             logspace(log10(304), log10(500), 150)];

   An m-file for the differential equation used above is included with
the Octave distribution in the examples directory under the name
‘oregonator.m’.

24.2 Differential-Algebraic Equations
=====================================

The function ‘daspk’ can be used to solve DAEs of the form

     0 = f (x-dot, x, t),    x(t=0) = x_0, x-dot(t=0) = x-dot_0

where x-dot is the derivative of x.  The equation is solved using
Petzold’s DAE solver DASPK.

 -- : [X, XDOT, ISTATE, MSG] = daspk (FCN, X_0, XDOT_0, T, T_CRIT)
     Solve a set of differential-algebraic equations.

     ‘daspk’ solves the set of equations

          0 = f (x, xdot, t)

     with

          x(t_0) = x_0, xdot(t_0) = xdot_0

     The solution is returned in the matrices X and XDOT, with each row
     in the result matrices corresponding to one of the elements in the
     vector T.  The first element of T should be t_0 and correspond to
     the initial state of the system X_0 and its derivative XDOT_0, so
     that the first row of the output X is X_0 and the first row of the
     output XDOT is XDOT_0.

     The first argument, FCN, is a string, inline, or function handle
     that names the function f to call to compute the vector of
     residuals for the set of equations.  It must have the form

          RES = f (X, XDOT, T)

     in which X, XDOT, and RES are vectors, and T is a scalar.

     If FCN is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array of
     strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element
     names the function f described above, and the second element names
     a function to compute the modified Jacobian

                df       df
          jac = -- + c ------
                dx     d xdot

     The modified Jacobian function must have the form


          JAC = j (X, XDOT, T, C)


     The second and third arguments to ‘daspk’ specify the initial
     condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth
     argument specifies a vector of output times at which the solution
     is desired, including the time corresponding to the initial
     condition.

     The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required
     to be consistent.  If they are not consistent, you must use the
     ‘daspk_options’ function to provide additional information so that
     ‘daspk’ can compute a consistent starting point.

     The fifth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of
     times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful
     for avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there
     is a discontinuity in the derivative.

     After a successful computation, the value of ISTATE will be greater
     than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of DASPK).

     If the computation is not successful, the value of ISTATE will be
     less than zero and MSG will contain additional information.

     You can use the function ‘daspk_options’ to set optional parameters
     for ‘daspk’.

     See also: *note dassl: XREFdassl.

 -- : daspk_options ()
 -- : val = daspk_options (OPT)
 -- : daspk_options (OPT, VAL)
     Query or set options for the function ‘daspk’.

     When called with no arguments, the names of all available options
     and their current values are displayed.

     Given one argument, return the value of the option OPT.

     When called with two arguments, ‘daspk_options’ sets the option OPT
     to value VAL.

     Options include

     "absolute tolerance"
          Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a
          vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector, and
          the relative tolerance must also be a vector of the same
          length.

     "relative tolerance"
          Relative tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a
          vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector, and
          the absolute tolerance must also be a vector of the same
          length.

          The local error test applied at each integration step is

                 abs (local error in x(i))
                      <= rtol(i) * abs (Y(i)) + atol(i)

     "compute consistent initial condition"
          Denoting the differential variables in the state vector by
          ‘Y_d’ and the algebraic variables by ‘Y_a’, ‘ddaspk’ can solve
          one of two initialization problems:

            1. Given Y_d, calculate Y_a and Y’_d

            2. Given Y’, calculate Y.

          In either case, initial values for the given components are
          input, and initial guesses for the unknown components must
          also be provided as input.  Set this option to 1 to solve the
          first problem, or 2 to solve the second (the default is 0, so
          you must provide a set of initial conditions that are
          consistent).

          If this option is set to a nonzero value, you must also set
          the "algebraic variables" option to declare which variables in
          the problem are algebraic.

     "use initial condition heuristics"
          Set to a nonzero value to use the initial condition heuristics
          options described below.

     "initial condition heuristics"
          A vector of the following parameters that can be used to
          control the initial condition calculation.

          ‘MXNIT’
               Maximum number of Newton iterations (default is 5).

          ‘MXNJ’
               Maximum number of Jacobian evaluations (default is 6).

          ‘MXNH’
               Maximum number of values of the artificial stepsize
               parameter to be tried if the "compute consistent initial
               condition" option has been set to 1 (default is 5).

               Note that the maximum total number of Newton iterations
               allowed is ‘MXNIT*MXNJ*MXNH’ if the "compute consistent
               initial condition" option has been set to 1 and
               ‘MXNIT*MXNJ’ if it is set to 2.

          ‘LSOFF’
               Set to a nonzero value to disable the linesearch
               algorithm (default is 0).

          ‘STPTOL’
               Minimum scaled step in linesearch algorithm (default is
               eps^(2/3)).

          ‘EPINIT’
               Swing factor in the Newton iteration convergence test.
               The test is applied to the residual vector, premultiplied
               by the approximate Jacobian.  For convergence, the
               weighted RMS norm of this vector (scaled by the error
               weights) must be less than ‘EPINIT*EPCON’, where ‘EPCON’
               = 0.33 is the analogous test constant used in the time
               steps.  The default is ‘EPINIT’ = 0.01.

     "print initial condition info"
          Set this option to a nonzero value to display detailed
          information about the initial condition calculation (default
          is 0).

     "exclude algebraic variables from error test"
          Set to a nonzero value to exclude algebraic variables from the
          error test.  You must also set the "algebraic variables"
          option to declare which variables in the problem are algebraic
          (default is 0).

     "algebraic variables"
          A vector of the same length as the state vector.  A nonzero
          element indicates that the corresponding element of the state
          vector is an algebraic variable (i.e., its derivative does not
          appear explicitly in the equation set).

          This option is required by the "compute consistent initial
          condition" and "exclude algebraic variables from error test"
          options.

     "enforce inequality constraints"
          Set to one of the following values to enforce the inequality
          constraints specified by the "inequality constraint types"
          option (default is 0).

            1. To have constraint checking only in the initial condition
               calculation.

            2. To enforce constraint checking during the integration.

            3. To enforce both options 1 and 2.

     "inequality constraint types"
          A vector of the same length as the state specifying the type
          of inequality constraint.  Each element of the vector
          corresponds to an element of the state and should be assigned
          one of the following codes

          -2
               Less than zero.

          -1
               Less than or equal to zero.

          0
               Not constrained.

          1
               Greater than or equal to zero.

          2
               Greater than zero.

          This option only has an effect if the "enforce inequality
          constraints" option is nonzero.

     "initial step size"
          Differential-algebraic problems may occasionally suffer from
          severe scaling difficulties on the first step.  If you know a
          great deal about the scaling of your problem, you can help to
          alleviate this problem by specifying an initial stepsize
          (default is computed automatically).

     "maximum order"
          Restrict the maximum order of the solution method.  This
          option must be between 1 and 5, inclusive (default is 5).

     "maximum step size"
          Setting the maximum stepsize will avoid passing over very
          large regions (default is not specified).

   Octave also includes DASSL, an earlier version of DASPK, and DASRT,
which can be used to solve DAEs with constraints (stopping conditions).

 -- : [X, XDOT, ISTATE, MSG] = dassl (FCN, X_0, XDOT_0, T, T_CRIT)
     Solve a set of differential-algebraic equations.

     ‘dassl’ solves the set of equations

          0 = f (x, xdot, t)

     with

          x(t_0) = x_0, xdot(t_0) = xdot_0

     The solution is returned in the matrices X and XDOT, with each row
     in the result matrices corresponding to one of the elements in the
     vector T.  The first element of T should be t_0 and correspond to
     the initial state of the system X_0 and its derivative XDOT_0, so
     that the first row of the output X is X_0 and the first row of the
     output XDOT is XDOT_0.

     The first argument, FCN, is a string, inline, or function handle
     that names the function f to call to compute the vector of
     residuals for the set of equations.  It must have the form

          RES = f (X, XDOT, T)

     in which X, XDOT, and RES are vectors, and T is a scalar.

     If FCN is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array of
     strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element
     names the function f described above, and the second element names
     a function to compute the modified Jacobian

                df       df
          jac = -- + c ------
                dx     d xdot

     The modified Jacobian function must have the form


          JAC = j (X, XDOT, T, C)


     The second and third arguments to ‘dassl’ specify the initial
     condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth
     argument specifies a vector of output times at which the solution
     is desired, including the time corresponding to the initial
     condition.

     The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required
     to be consistent.  In practice, however, DASSL is not very good at
     determining a consistent set for you, so it is best if you ensure
     that the initial values result in the function evaluating to zero.

     The fifth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of
     times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful
     for avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there
     is a discontinuity in the derivative.

     After a successful computation, the value of ISTATE will be greater
     than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of DASSL).

     If the computation is not successful, the value of ISTATE will be
     less than zero and MSG will contain additional information.

     You can use the function ‘dassl_options’ to set optional parameters
     for ‘dassl’.

     See also: *note daspk: XREFdaspk, *note dasrt: XREFdasrt, *note
     lsode: XREFlsode.

 -- : dassl_options ()
 -- : val = dassl_options (OPT)
 -- : dassl_options (OPT, VAL)
     Query or set options for the function ‘dassl’.

     When called with no arguments, the names of all available options
     and their current values are displayed.

     Given one argument, return the value of the option OPT.

     When called with two arguments, ‘dassl_options’ sets the option OPT
     to value VAL.

     Options include

     "absolute tolerance"
          Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a
          vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector, and
          the relative tolerance must also be a vector of the same
          length.

     "relative tolerance"
          Relative tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a
          vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector, and
          the absolute tolerance must also be a vector of the same
          length.

          The local error test applied at each integration step is

                 abs (local error in x(i))
                      <= rtol(i) * abs (Y(i)) + atol(i)

     "compute consistent initial condition"
          If nonzero, ‘dassl’ will attempt to compute a consistent set
          of initial conditions.  This is generally not reliable, so it
          is best to provide a consistent set and leave this option set
          to zero.

     "enforce nonnegativity constraints"
          If you know that the solutions to your equations will always
          be non-negative, it may help to set this parameter to a
          nonzero value.  However, it is probably best to try leaving
          this option set to zero first, and only setting it to a
          nonzero value if that doesn’t work very well.

     "initial step size"
          Differential-algebraic problems may occasionally suffer from
          severe scaling difficulties on the first step.  If you know a
          great deal about the scaling of your problem, you can help to
          alleviate this problem by specifying an initial stepsize.

     "maximum order"
          Restrict the maximum order of the solution method.  This
          option must be between 1 and 5, inclusive.

     "maximum step size"
          Setting the maximum stepsize will avoid passing over very
          large regions (default is not specified).

     "step limit"
          Maximum number of integration steps to attempt on a single
          call to the underlying Fortran code.

 -- : [X, XDOT, T_OUT, ISTAT, MSG] = dasrt (FCN, G, X_0, XDOT_0, T)
 -- : ... = dasrt (FCN, G, X_0, XDOT_0, T, T_CRIT)
 -- : ... = dasrt (FCN, X_0, XDOT_0, T)
 -- : ... = dasrt (FCN, X_0, XDOT_0, T, T_CRIT)
     Solve a set of differential-algebraic equations.

     ‘dasrt’ solves the set of equations

          0 = f (x, xdot, t)

     with

          x(t_0) = x_0, xdot(t_0) = xdot_0

     with functional stopping criteria (root solving).

     The solution is returned in the matrices X and XDOT, with each row
     in the result matrices corresponding to one of the elements in the
     vector T_OUT.  The first element of T should be t_0 and correspond
     to the initial state of the system X_0 and its derivative XDOT_0,
     so that the first row of the output X is X_0 and the first row of
     the output XDOT is XDOT_0.

     The vector T provides an upper limit on the length of the
     integration.  If the stopping condition is met, the vector T_OUT
     will be shorter than T, and the final element of T_OUT will be the
     point at which the stopping condition was met, and may not
     correspond to any element of the vector T.

     The first argument, FCN, is a string, inline, or function handle
     that names the function f to call to compute the vector of
     residuals for the set of equations.  It must have the form

          RES = f (X, XDOT, T)

     in which X, XDOT, and RES are vectors, and T is a scalar.

     If FCN is a two-element string array or a two-element cell array of
     strings, inline functions, or function handles, the first element
     names the function f described above, and the second element names
     a function to compute the modified Jacobian

                df       df
          jac = -- + c ------
                dx     d xdot

     The modified Jacobian function must have the form


          JAC = j (X, XDOT, T, C)


     The optional second argument names a function that defines the
     constraint functions whose roots are desired during the
     integration.  This function must have the form

          G_OUT = g (X, T)

     and return a vector of the constraint function values.  If the
     value of any of the constraint functions changes sign, DASRT will
     attempt to stop the integration at the point of the sign change.

     If the name of the constraint function is omitted, ‘dasrt’ solves
     the same problem as ‘daspk’ or ‘dassl’.

     Note that because of numerical errors in the constraint functions
     due to round-off and integration error, DASRT may return false
     roots, or return the same root at two or more nearly equal values
     of T.  If such false roots are suspected, the user should consider
     smaller error tolerances or higher precision in the evaluation of
     the constraint functions.

     If a root of some constraint function defines the end of the
     problem, the input to DASRT should nevertheless allow integration
     to a point slightly past that root, so that DASRT can locate the
     root by interpolation.

     The third and fourth arguments to ‘dasrt’ specify the initial
     condition of the states and their derivatives, and the fourth
     argument specifies a vector of output times at which the solution
     is desired, including the time corresponding to the initial
     condition.

     The set of initial states and derivatives are not strictly required
     to be consistent.  In practice, however, DASSL is not very good at
     determining a consistent set for you, so it is best if you ensure
     that the initial values result in the function evaluating to zero.

     The sixth argument is optional, and may be used to specify a set of
     times that the DAE solver should not integrate past.  It is useful
     for avoiding difficulties with singularities and points where there
     is a discontinuity in the derivative.

     After a successful computation, the value of ISTATE will be greater
     than zero (consistent with the Fortran version of DASSL).

     If the computation is not successful, the value of ISTATE will be
     less than zero and MSG will contain additional information.

     You can use the function ‘dasrt_options’ to set optional parameters
     for ‘dasrt’.

     See also: *note dasrt_options: XREFdasrt_options, *note daspk:
     XREFdaspk, *note dasrt: XREFdasrt, *note lsode: XREFlsode.

 -- : dasrt_options ()
 -- : val = dasrt_options (OPT)
 -- : dasrt_options (OPT, VAL)
     Query or set options for the function ‘dasrt’.

     When called with no arguments, the names of all available options
     and their current values are displayed.

     Given one argument, return the value of the option OPT.

     When called with two arguments, ‘dasrt_options’ sets the option OPT
     to value VAL.

     Options include

     "absolute tolerance"
          Absolute tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a
          vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector, and
          the relative tolerance must also be a vector of the same
          length.

     "relative tolerance"
          Relative tolerance.  May be either vector or scalar.  If a
          vector, it must match the dimension of the state vector, and
          the absolute tolerance must also be a vector of the same
          length.

          The local error test applied at each integration step is

                 abs (local error in x(i)) <= ...
                     rtol(i) * abs (Y(i)) + atol(i)

24.3 Matlab-compatible solvers
==============================

Octave also provides a set of solvers for initial value problems for
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that have a MATLAB-compatible
interface.  The options for this class of methods are set using the
functions.

   • *note odeset: XREFodeset.

   • *note odeget: XREFodeget.

   Currently implemented solvers are:

   • Runge-Kutta methods

        • *note ode45: XREFode45. integrates a system of non-stiff ODEs
          or index-1 differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) using the
          high-order, variable-step Dormand-Prince method.  It requires
          six function evaluations per integration step, but may take
          larger steps on smooth problems than ‘ode23’: potentially
          offering improved efficiency at smaller tolerances.

        • *note ode23: XREFode23. integrates a system of non-stiff ODEs
          or (or index-1 DAEs).  It uses the third-order
          Bogacki-Shampine method and adapts the local step size in
          order to satisfy a user-specified tolerance.  The solver
          requires three function evaluations per integration step.

        • *note ode23s: XREFode23s. integrates a system of stiff ODEs
          (or index-1 DAEs) using a modified second-order Rosenbrock
          method.

   • Linear multistep methods

        • *note ode15s: XREFode15s. integrates a system of stiff ODEs
          (or index-1 DAEs) using a variable step, variable order method
          based on Backward Difference Formulas (BDF).

        • *note ode15i: XREFode15i. integrates a system of
          fully-implicit ODEs (or index-1 DAEs) using the same variable
          step, variable order method as ‘ode15s’.  *note decic:
          XREFdecic. can be used to compute consistent initial
          conditions for ‘ode15i’.

   Detailed information on the solvers are given in L. F. Shampine and
M. W. Reichelt, ‘The MATLAB ODE Suite’, SIAM Journal on Scientific
Computing, Vol.  18, 1997, pp.  1–22, DOI:
<https://doi.org/10.1137/S1064827594276424>.

 -- : [T, Y] = ode45 (FUN, TRANGE, INIT)
 -- : [T, Y] = ode45 (FUN, TRANGE, INIT, ODE_OPT)
 -- : [T, Y, TE, YE, IE] = ode45 (...)
 -- : SOLUTION = ode45 (...)
 -- : ode45 (...)

     Solve a set of non-stiff Ordinary Differential Equations (non-stiff
     ODEs) with the well known explicit Dormand-Prince method of order
     4.

     FUN is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function that defines the ODE: ‘y' = f(t,y)’.  The
     function must accept two inputs where the first is time T and the
     second is a column vector of unknowns Y.

     TRANGE specifies the time interval over which the ODE will be
     evaluated.  Typically, it is a two-element vector specifying the
     initial and final times (‘[tinit, tfinal]’).  If there are more
     than two elements then the solution will also be evaluated at these
     intermediate time instances.

     By default, ‘ode45’ uses an adaptive timestep with the
     ‘integrate_adaptive’ algorithm.  The tolerance for the timestep
     computation may be changed by using the options "RelTol" and
     "AbsTol".

     INIT contains the initial value for the unknowns.  If it is a row
     vector then the solution Y will be a matrix in which each column is
     the solution for the corresponding initial value in INIT.

     The optional fourth argument ODE_OPT specifies non-default options
     to the ODE solver.  It is a structure generated by ‘odeset’.

     The function typically returns two outputs.  Variable T is a column
     vector and contains the times where the solution was found.  The
     output Y is a matrix in which each column refers to a different
     unknown of the problem and each row corresponds to a time in T.

     The output can also be returned as a structure SOLUTION which has a
     field X containing a row vector of times where the solution was
     evaluated and a field Y containing the solution matrix such that
     each column corresponds to a time in X.  Use
     ‘fieldnames (SOLUTION)’ to see the other fields and additional
     information returned.

     If no output arguments are requested, and no "OutputFcn" is
     specified in ODE_OPT, then the "OutputFcn" is set to ‘odeplot’ and
     the results of the solver are plotted immediately.

     If using the "Events" option then three additional outputs may be
     returned.  TE holds the time when an Event function returned a
     zero.  YE holds the value of the solution at time TE.  IE contains
     an index indicating which Event function was triggered in the case
     of multiple Event functions.

     Example: Solve the Van der Pol equation

          fvdp = @(T,Y) [Y(2); (1 - Y(1)^2) * Y(2) - Y(1)];

     Solve a set of non-stiff Ordinary Differential Equations (non-stiff
     ODEs) with the well known explicit Bogacki-Shampine method of order
     3.

     FUN is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function that defines the ODE: ‘y' = f(t,y)’.  The
     function must accept two inputs where the first is time T and the
     second is a column vector of unknowns Y.

     TRANGE specifies the time interval over which the ODE will be
     evaluated.  Typically, it is a two-element vector specifying the
     initial and final times (‘[tinit, tfinal]’).  If there are more
     than two elements then the solution will also be evaluated at these
     intermediate time instances.

     By default, ‘ode23’ uses an adaptive timestep with the
     ‘integrate_adaptive’ algorithm.  The tolerance for the timestep
     computation may be changed by using the options "RelTol" and
     "AbsTol".

     INIT contains the initial value for the unknowns.  If it is a row
     vector then the solution Y will be a matrix in which each column is
     the solution for the corresponding initial value in INIT.

     The optional fourth argument ODE_OPT specifies non-default options
     to the ODE solver.  It is a structure generated by ‘odeset’.

     The function typically returns two outputs.  Variable T is a column
     vector and contains the times where the solution was found.  The
     output Y is a matrix in which each column refers to a different
     unknown of the problem and each row corresponds to a time in T.

     The output can also be returned as a structure SOLUTION which has a
     field X containing a row vector of times where the solution was
     evaluated and a field Y containing the solution matrix such that
     each column corresponds to a time in X.  Use
     ‘fieldnames (SOLUTION)’ to see the other fields and additional
     information returned.

     If no output arguments are requested, and no "OutputFcn" is
     specified in ODE_OPT, then the "OutputFcn" is set to ‘odeplot’ and
     the results of the solver are plotted immediately.

     If using the "Events" option then three additional outputs may be
     returned.  TE holds the time when an Event function returned a
     zero.  YE holds the value of the solution at time TE.  IE contains
     an index indicating which Event function was triggered in the case
     of multiple Event functions.

     Example: Solve the Van der Pol equation

          fvdp = @(T,Y) [Y(2); (1 - Y(1)^2) * Y(2) - Y(1)];
          [T,Y] = ode23 (fvdp, [0, 20], [2, 0]);

     Solve a set of stiff Ordinary Differential Equations (stiff ODEs)
     with a Rosenbrock method of order (2,3).

     FUN is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function that defines the ODE: ‘M y' = f(t,y)’.  The
     function must accept two inputs where the first is time T and the
     second is a column vector of unknowns Y.  M is a constant mass
     matrix, non-singular and possibly sparse.  Set the field "Mass" in
     ODEOPTS using ODESET to specify a mass matrix.

     TRANGE specifies the time interval over which the ODE will be
     evaluated.  Typically, it is a two-element vector specifying the
     initial and final times (‘[tinit, tfinal]’).  If there are more
     than two elements then the solution will also be evaluated at these
     intermediate time instances using an interpolation procedure of the
     same order as the one of the solver.

     By default, ‘ode23s’ uses an adaptive timestep with the
     ‘integrate_adaptive’ algorithm.  The tolerance for the timestep
     computation may be changed by using the options "RelTol" and
     "AbsTol".

     INIT contains the initial value for the unknowns.  If it is a row
     vector then the solution Y will be a matrix in which each column is
     the solution for the corresponding initial value in INIT.

     The optional fourth argument ODE_OPT specifies non-default options
     to the ODE solver.  It is a structure generated by ‘odeset’.
     ‘ode23s’ will ignore the following options: "BDF", "InitialSlope",
     "MassSingular", "MStateDependence", "MvPattern", "MaxOrder",
     "Non-negative".

     The function typically returns two outputs.  Variable T is a column
     vector and contains the times where the solution was found.  The
     output Y is a matrix in which each column refers to a different
     unknown of the problem and each row corresponds to a time in T.  If
     TRANGE specifies intermediate time steps, only those will be
     returned.

     The output can also be returned as a structure SOLUTION which has a
     field X containing a row vector of times where the solution was
     evaluated and a field Y containing the solution matrix such that
     each column corresponds to a time in X.  Use
     ‘fieldnames (SOLUTION)’ to see the other fields and additional
     information returned.

     If using the "Events" option then three additional outputs may be
     returned.  TE holds the time when an Event function returned a
     zero.  YE holds the value of the solution at time TE.  IE contains
     an index indicating which Event function was triggered in the case
     of multiple Event functions.

     Example: Solve the stiff Van der Pol equation

          f = @(T,Y) [Y(2); 1000*(1 - Y(1)^2) * Y(2) - Y(1)];
          opt = odeset ('Mass', [1 0; 0 1], 'MaxStep', 1e-1);

     Solve a set of stiff Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) or

     (DAEs).

     ‘ode15s’ uses a variable step, variable order BDF (Backward
     Differentiation Formula) method that ranges from order 1 to 5.

     FUN is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the

     Example: Solve Robertson’s equations:

          function r = robertson_dae (T, Y)
            r = [ -0.04*Y(1) + 1e4*Y(2)*Y(3)

     Solve a set of fully-implicit Ordinary Differential Equations
     (ODEs) or index 1 Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs).

     ‘ode15i’ uses a variable step, variable order BDF (Backward
     Differentiation Formula) method that ranges from order 1 to 5.

     FUN is a function handle, inline function, or string containing the
     name of the function that defines the ODE: ‘0 = f(t,y,yp)’.  The
     function must accept three inputs where the first is time T, the
     second is the function value Y (a column vector), and the third is
     the derivative value YP (a column vector).

     TRANGE specifies the time interval over which the ODE will be
     evaluated.  Typically, it is a two-element vector specifying the
     initial and final times (‘[tinit, tfinal]’).  If there are more
     than two elements then the solution will also be evaluated at these
     intermediate time instances.

     Y0 and YP0 contain the initial values for the unknowns Y and YP.
     If they are row vectors then the solution Y will be a matrix in
     which each column is the solution for the corresponding initial
     value in Y0 and YP0.

     Y0 and YP0 must be consistent initial conditions, meaning that
     ‘f(t,y0,yp0) = 0’ is satisfied.  The function ‘decic’ may be used
     to compute consistent initial conditions given initial guesses.

     The optional fifth argument ODE_OPT specifies non-default options
     to the ODE solver.  It is a structure generated by ‘odeset’.

     The function typically returns two outputs.  Variable T is a column
     vector and contains the times where the solution was found.  The
     output Y is a matrix in which each column refers to a different
     unknown of the problem and each row corresponds to a time in T.

     The output can also be returned as a structure SOLUTION which has a
     field X containing a row vector of times where the solution was
     evaluated and a field Y containing the solution matrix such that
     each column corresponds to a time in X.  Use
     ‘fieldnames (SOLUTION)’ to see the other fields and additional
     information returned.

     If no output arguments are requested, and no "OutputFcn" is
     specified in ODE_OPT, then the "OutputFcn" is set to ‘odeplot’ and
     the results of the solver are plotted immediately.

     If using the "Events" option then three additional outputs may be
     returned.  TE holds the time when an Event function returned a
     zero.  YE holds the value of the solution at time TE.  IE contains
     an index indicating which Event function was triggered in the case
     of multiple Event functions.

     Example: Solve Robertson’s equations:

          function r = robertson_dae (T, Y, YP)
            r = [ -(YP(1) + 0.04*Y(1) - 1e4*Y(2)*Y(3))
                  -(YP(2) - 0.04*Y(1) + 1e4*Y(2)*Y(3) + 3e7*Y(2)^2)
          Y(1) + Y(2) + Y(3) - 1 ];
          endfunction
          [T,Y] = ode15i (@robertson_dae, [0, 1e3], [1; 0; 0], [-1e-4; 1e-4; 0]);

     Compute consistent implicit ODE initial conditions Y0_NEW and
     YP0_NEW given initial guesses Y0 and YP0.

     A maximum of ‘length (Y0)’ components between FIXED_Y0 and
     FIXED_YP0 may be chosen as fixed values.

     FUN is a function handle.  The function must accept three inputs
     where the first is time T, the second is a column vector of
     unknowns Y, and the third is a column vector of unknowns YP.

     T0 is the initial time such that ‘FUN(T0, Y0_NEW, YP0_NEW) = 0’,
     specified as a scalar.

     Y0 is a vector used as the initial guess for Y.

     FIXED_Y0 is a vector which specifies the components of Y0 to hold
     fixed.  Choose a maximum of ‘length (Y0)’ components between
     FIXED_Y0 and FIXED_YP0 as fixed values.  Set FIXED_Y0(i) component
     to 1 if you want to fix the value of Y0(i).  Set FIXED_Y0(i)
     component to 0 if you want to allow the value of Y0(i) to change.

     YP0 is a vector used as the initial guess for YP.

     FIXED_YP0 is a vector which specifies the components of YP0 to hold
     fixed.  Choose a maximum of ‘length (YP0)’ components between
     FIXED_Y0 and FIXED_YP0 as fixed values.  Set FIXED_YP0(i) component
     to 1 if you want to fix the value of YP0(i).  Set FIXED_YP0(i)
     component to 0 if you want to allow the value of YP0(i) to change.

     The optional seventh argument OPTIONS is a structure array.  Use
     ‘odeset’ to generate this structure.  The relevant options are
     ‘RelTol’ and ‘AbsTol’ which specify the error thresholds used to
     compute the initial conditions.

     The function typically returns two outputs.  Variable Y0_NEW is a
     column vector and contains the consistent initial value of Y.  The
     output YP0_NEW is a column vector and contains the consistent
     initial value of YP.

     The optional third output RESNORM is the norm of the vector of
     residuals.  If RESNORM is small, ‘decic’ has successfully computed
     the initial conditions.  If the value of RESNORM is large, use
     ‘RelTol’ and ‘AbsTol’ to adjust it.

     Example: Compute initial conditions for Robertson’s equations:

          function r = robertson_dae (T, Y, YP)
            r = [ -(YP(1) + 0.04*Y(1) - 1e4*Y(2)*Y(3))
                  -(YP(2) - 0.04*Y(1) + 1e4*Y(2)*Y(3) + 3e7*Y(2)^2)
          Y(1) + Y(2) + Y(3) - 1 ];
          endfunction
          [Y0_NEW,YP0_NEW] = decic (@robertson_dae, 0, [1; 0; 0], [1; 1; 0],
          [-1e-4; 1; 0], [0; 0; 0]);

     Create or modify an ODE options structure.

     When called with no input argument and one output argument, return
     a new ODE options structure that contains all possible fields
     initialized to their default values.  If no output argument is
     requested, display a list of the common ODE solver options along
     with their default value.

     If called with name-value input argument pairs "FIELD1", "VALUE1",
     "FIELD2", "VALUE2", ... return a new ODE options structure with all
     the most common option fields initialized, *and* set the values of
     the fields "FIELD1", "FIELD2", ... to the values VALUE1, VALUE2,
     ....

     If called with an input structure OLDSTRUCT then overwrite the
     values of the options "FIELD1", "FIELD2", ... with new values
     VALUE1, VALUE2, ... and return the modified structure.

     When called with two input ODE options structures OLDSTRUCT and
     NEWSTRUCT overwrite all values from the structure OLDSTRUCT with
     new values from the structure NEWSTRUCT.  Empty values in NEWSTRUCT
     will not overwrite values in OLDSTRUCT.

     The most commonly used ODE options, which are always assigned a
     value by ‘odeset’, are the following:

     ‘AbsTol’: positive scalar | vector, def. ‘1e-6’
          Absolute error tolerance.

     ‘BDF’: {"off"} | "on"
          Use BDF formulas in implicit multistep methods.  _Note_: This
          option is not yet implemented.

     ‘Events’: function_handle
          Event function.  An event function must have the form ‘[value,
          isterminal, direction] = my_events_f (t, y)’

     ‘InitialSlope’: vector
          Consistent initial slope vector for DAE solvers.

     ‘InitialStep’: positive scalar
          Initial time step size.

     ‘Jacobian’: matrix | function_handle
          Jacobian matrix, specified as a constant matrix or a function
          of time and state.

     ‘JConstant’: {"off"} | "on"
          Specify whether the Jacobian is a constant matrix or depends
          on the state.

     ‘JPattern’: sparse matrix
          If the Jacobian matrix is sparse and non-constant but
          maintains a constant sparsity pattern, specify the sparsity
          pattern.

     ‘Mass’: matrix | function_handle
          Mass matrix, specified as a constant matrix or a function of
          time and state.

     ‘MassSingular’: {"maybe"} | "yes" | "on"
          Specify whether the mass matrix is singular.

     ‘MaxOrder’: {5} | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1
          Maximum order of formula.

     ‘MaxStep’: positive scalar
          Maximum time step value.

     ‘MStateDependence’: {"weak"} | "none" | "strong"
          Specify whether the mass matrix depends on the state or only
          on time.

     ‘MvPattern’: sparse matrix
          If the mass matrix is sparse and non-constant but maintains a
          constant sparsity pattern, specify the sparsity pattern.
          _Note_: This option is not yet implemented.

     ‘NonNegative’: scalar | vector
          Specify elements of the state vector that are expected to
          remain non-negative during the simulation.

     ‘NormControl’: {"off"} | "on"
          Control error relative to the 2-norm of the solution, rather
          than its absolute value.

     ‘OutputFcn’: function_handle
          Function to monitor the state during the simulation.  For the
          form of the function to use *note ‘odeplot’: XREFodeplot.

     ‘OutputSel’: scalar | vector
          Indices of elements of the state vector to be passed to the
          output monitoring function.

     ‘Refine’: positive scalar
          Specify whether output should be returned only at the end of
          each time step or also at intermediate time instances.  The
          value should be a scalar indicating the number of equally
          spaced time points to use within each timestep at which to
          return output.  _Note_: This option is not yet implemented.

     ‘RelTol’: positive scalar
          Relative error tolerance.

     ‘Stats’: {"off"} | "on"
          Print solver statistics after simulation.

     ‘Vectorized’: {"off"} | "on"
          Specify whether ‘odefun’ can be passed multiple values of the
          state at once.

     Field names that are not in the above list are also accepted and
     added to the result structure.

     See also: *note odeget: XREFodeget.

 -- : VAL = odeget (ODE_OPT, FIELD)
 -- : VAL = odeget (ODE_OPT, FIELD, DEFAULT)

     Query the value of the property FIELD in the ODE options structure
     ODE_OPT.

     If called with two input arguments and the first input argument
     ODE_OPT is an ODE option structure and the second input argument
     FIELD is a string specifying an option name, then return the option
     value VAL corresponding to FIELD from ODE_OPT.

     If called with an optional third input argument, and FIELD is not
     set in the structure ODE_OPT, then return the default value DEFAULT
     instead.

     See also: *note odeset: XREFodeset.

 -- : STOP_SOLVE = odeplot (T, Y, FLAG)

     Open a new figure window and plot the solution of an ode problem at
     each time step during the integration.

     The types and values of the input parameters T and Y depend on the
     input FLAG that is of type string.  Valid values of FLAG are:

     ‘"init"’
          The input T must be a column vector of length 2 with the first
          and last time step (‘[TFIRST TLAST]’.  The input Y contains
          the initial conditions for the ode problem (Y0).

     ‘""’
          The input T must be a scalar double specifying the time for
          which the solution in input Y was calculated.

     ‘"done"’
          The inputs should be empty, but are ignored if they are
          present.

     ‘odeplot’ always returns false, i.e., don’t stop the ode solver.

     Example: solve an anonymous implementation of the "Van der Pol"
     equation and display the results while solving.

          fvdp = @(t,y) [y(2); (1 - y(1)^2) * y(2) - y(1)];

          opt = odeset ("OutputFcn", @odeplot, "RelTol", 1e-6);
          sol = ode45 (fvdp, [0 20], [2 0], opt);

     Background Information: This function is called by an ode solver
     function if it was specified in the "OutputFcn" property of an
     options structure created with ‘odeset’.  The ode solver will
     initially call the function with the syntax ‘odeplot ([TFIRST,
     TLAST], Y0, "init")’.  The function initializes internal variables,
     creates a new figure window, and sets the x limits of the plot.
     Subsequently, at each time step during the integration the ode
     solver calls ‘odeplot (T, Y, [])’.  At the end of the solution the
     ode solver calls ‘odeplot ([], [], "done")’ so that odeplot can
     perform any clean-up actions required.

25.1 Linear Programming
=======================

Octave can solve Linear Programming problems using the ‘glpk’ function.
That is, Octave can solve

     min C'*x

   subject to the linear constraints A*x = b where x ≥ 0.

The ‘glpk’ function also supports variations of this problem.

 -- : [XOPT, FMIN, ERRNUM, EXTRA] = glpk (C, A, B, LB, UB, CTYPE,
          VARTYPE, SENSE, PARAM)
     Solve a linear program using the GNU GLPK library.

     Given three arguments, ‘glpk’ solves the following standard LP:

          min C'*x

     subject to

          A*x  = b
            x >= 0

     but may also solve problems of the form

          [ min | max ] C'*x

     subject to

          A*x [ "=" | "<=" | ">=" ] b
            x >= LB
            x <= UB

     Input arguments:

     C
          A column array containing the objective function coefficients.

     A
          A matrix containing the constraints coefficients.

     B
          A column array containing the right-hand side value for each
          constraint in the constraint matrix.

     LB
          An array containing the lower bound on each of the variables.
          If LB is not supplied, the default lower bound for the
          variables is zero.

     UB
          An array containing the upper bound on each of the variables.
          If UB is not supplied, the default upper bound is assumed to
          be infinite.

     CTYPE
          An array of characters containing the sense of each constraint
          in the constraint matrix.  Each element of the array may be
          one of the following values

          "F"
               A free (unbounded) constraint (the constraint is
               ignored).

          "U"
               An inequality constraint with an upper bound (‘A(i,:)*x
               <= b(i)’).

          "S"
               An equality constraint (‘A(i,:)*x = b(i)’).

          "L"
               An inequality with a lower bound (‘A(i,:)*x >= b(i)’).

          "D"
               An inequality constraint with both upper and lower bounds
               (‘A(i,:)*x >= -b(i)’) _and_ (‘A(i,:)*x <= b(i)’).

     VARTYPE
          A column array containing the types of the variables.

          "C"
               A continuous variable.

          "I"
               An integer variable.

     SENSE
          If SENSE is 1, the problem is a minimization.  If SENSE is -1,
          the problem is a maximization.  The default value is 1.

     PARAM
          A structure containing the following parameters used to define
          the behavior of solver.  Missing elements in the structure
          take on default values, so you only need to set the elements
          that you wish to change from the default.

          Integer parameters:

          ‘msglev (default: 1)’
               Level of messages output by solver routines:

               0 (‘GLP_MSG_OFF’)

               3 (‘GLP_MSG_ALL’)

          ‘scale (default: 16)’
               Scaling option.  The values can be combined with the
               bitwise OR operator and may be the following:

               1 (‘GLP_SF_GM’)
                    Geometric mean scaling.

               16 (‘GLP_SF_EQ’)
                    Equilibration scaling.

               32 (‘GLP_SF_2N’)

               3 (‘GLP_DUAL’)
                    Use two-phase dual simplex.

          ‘price (default: 34)’

               time when one simplex iteration has been performed, and
               reaching zero value signals the solver to stop the
               search.

          ‘outfrq (default: 200)’
               Output frequency, in iterations.  This parameter
               specifies how frequently the solver sends information
               about the solution to the standard output.

          ‘branch (default: 4)’

          ‘presol (default: 1)’
               If this flag is set, the simplex solver uses the built-in
               LP presolver.  Otherwise the LP presolver is not used.

          ‘lpsolver (default: 1)’
               Select which solver to use.  If the problem is a MIP
               problem this flag will be ignored.

               1
                    Revised simplex method.

               2
                    Interior point method.

          ‘rtest (default: 34)’
               Ratio test technique:

               17 (‘GLP_RT_STD’)
                    Standard ("textbook").

               34 (‘GLP_RT_HAR’)

          ‘tmlim (default: intmax)’
               Searching time limit, in milliseconds.

          ‘outdly (default: 0)’

               the solution to the standard output.

          ‘save (default: 0)’
               If this parameter is nonzero, save a copy of the problem
               in CPLEX LP format to the file ‘"outpb.lp"’.  There is
               currently no way to change the name of the output file.

          Real parameters:

          ‘tolbnd (default: 1e-7)’
               Relative tolerance used to check if the current basic
               solution is primal feasible.  It is not recommended that
               you change this parameter unless you have a detailed
               understanding of its purpose.

          ‘toldj (default: 1e-7)’
               Absolute tolerance used to check if the current basic
               solution is dual feasible.  It is not recommended that

               understanding of its purpose.

          ‘objll (default: -DBL_MAX)’
               Lower limit of the objective function.  If the objective
               function reaches this limit and continues decreasing, the
               solver stops the search.  This parameter is used in the
               dual simplex method only.

          ‘objul (default: +DBL_MAX)’
               Upper limit of the objective function.  If the objective
               function reaches this limit and continues increasing, the
               solver stops the search.  This parameter is used in the
               dual simplex only.

          ‘tolint (default: 1e-5)’
               Relative tolerance used to check if the current basic

               objective function is not better than in the best known
               integer feasible solution.  It is not recommended that
               you change this parameter unless you have a detailed
               understanding of its purpose.

25.2 Quadratic Programming
==========================

Octave can also solve Quadratic Programming problems, this is

     min 0.5 x'*H*x + x'*q

   subject to

          A*x = b
          lb <= x <= ub
          A_lb <= A_in*x <= A_ub

 -- : [X, OBJ, INFO, LAMBDA] = qp (X0, H)
 -- : [X, OBJ, INFO, LAMBDA] = qp (X0, H, Q)
 -- : [X, OBJ, INFO, LAMBDA] = qp (X0, H, Q, A, B)
 -- : [X, OBJ, INFO, LAMBDA] = qp (X0, H, Q, A, B, LB, UB)
 -- : [X, OBJ, INFO, LAMBDA] = qp (X0, H, Q, A, B, LB, UB, A_LB, A_IN,
          A_UB)
 -- : [X, OBJ, INFO, LAMBDA] = qp (..., OPTIONS)
     Solve a quadratic program (QP).

     Solve the quadratic program defined by

          min 0.5 x'*H*x + x'*q
           x

     subject to

          A*x = b
          lb <= x <= ub
          A_lb <= A_in*x <= A_ub

     using a null-space active-set method.

     Any bound (A, B, LB, UB, A_IN, A_LB, A_UB) may be set to the empty
     matrix (‘[]’) if not present.  The constraints A and A_IN are
     matrices with each row representing a single constraint.  The other
     bounds are scalars or vectors depending on the number of
     constraints.  The algorithm is faster if the initial guess is
     feasible.

     OPTIONS is a structure specifying additional parameters which
     control the algorithm.  Currently, ‘qp’ recognizes these options:
     "MaxIter", "TolX".

     "MaxIter" proscribes the maximum number of algorithm iterations
     before optimization is halted.  The default value is 200.  The
     value must be a positive integer.

     "TolX" specifies the termination tolerance for the unknown
     variables X.  The default is ‘sqrt (eps)’ or approximately 1e-8.

     On return, X is the location of the minimum and FVAL contains the
     value of the objective function at X.

     INFO
          Structure containing run-time information about the algorithm.
          The following fields are defined:

          ‘solveiter’
               The number of iterations required to find the solution.

          ‘info’
               An integer indicating the status of the solution.

               0
                    The problem is feasible and convex.  Global solution
                    found.

               1
                    The problem is not convex.  Local solution found.

               2
                    The problem is not convex and unbounded.

               3
                    Maximum number of iterations reached.

               6
                    The problem is infeasible.

 -- : X = pqpnonneg (C, D)
 -- : X = pqpnonneg (C, D, X0)
 -- : X = pqpnonneg (C, D, X0, OPTIONS)
 -- : [X, MINVAL] = pqpnonneg (...)
 -- : [X, MINVAL, EXITFLAG] = pqpnonneg (...)
 -- : [X, MINVAL, EXITFLAG, OUTPUT] = pqpnonneg (...)
 -- : [X, MINVAL, EXITFLAG, OUTPUT, LAMBDA] = pqpnonneg (...)

     Minimize ‘1/2*X'*C*X + D'*X’ subject to ‘X >= 0’.

     C and D must be real matrices, and C must be symmetric and positive
     definite.

     X0 is an optional initial guess for the solution X.

     OPTIONS is an options structure to change the behavior of the
     algorithm (*note ‘optimset’: XREFoptimset.).  ‘pqpnonneg’
     recognizes one option: "MaxIter".

     Outputs:

     X
          The solution matrix

     MINVAL
          The minimum attained model value, ‘1/2*XMIN'*C*XMIN + D'*XMIN’

     EXITFLAG
          An indicator of convergence.  0 indicates that the iteration
          count was exceeded, and therefore convergence was not reached;
          >0 indicates that the algorithm converged.  (The algorithm is
          stable and will converge given enough iterations.)

     OUTPUT
          A structure with two fields:

             • "algorithm": The algorithm used ("nnls")

             • "iterations": The number of iterations taken.

     LAMBDA
          Undocumented output

Octave can also perform general nonlinear minimization using a
successive quadratic programming solver.

 -- : [X, OBJ, INFO, ITER, NF, LAMBDA] = sqp (X0, PHI)
 -- : [...] = sqp (X0, PHI, G)
 -- : [...] = sqp (X0, PHI, G, H)
 -- : [...] = sqp (X0, PHI, G, H, LB, UB)
 -- : [...] = sqp (X0, PHI, G, H, LB, UB, MAXITER)
 -- : [...] = sqp (X0, PHI, G, H, LB, UB, MAXITER, TOLERANCE)
     Minimize an objective function using sequential quadratic
     programming (SQP).

     Solve the nonlinear program

          min phi (x)
           x

     subject to

          g(x)  = 0
          h(x) >= 0
          lb <= x <= ub

     using a sequential quadratic programming method.

     The first argument is the initial guess for the vector X0.

     The second argument is a function handle pointing to the objective
     function PHI.  The objective function must accept one vector
     argument and return a scalar.

     The second argument may also be a 2- or 3-element cell array of
     function handles.  The first element should point to the objective
     function, the second should point to a function that computes the
     gradient of the objective function, and the third should point to a
     function that computes the Hessian of the objective function.  If
     the gradient function is not supplied, the gradient is computed by
     finite differences.  If the Hessian function is not supplied, a
     BFGS update formula is used to approximate the Hessian.

     When supplied, the gradient function ‘PHI{2}’ must accept one
     vector argument and return a vector.  When supplied, the Hessian
     function ‘PHI{3}’ must accept one vector argument and return a
     matrix.

     The third and fourth arguments G and H are function handles
     pointing to functions that compute the equality constraints and the
     inequality constraints, respectively.  If the problem does not have
     equality (or inequality) constraints, then use an empty matrix ([])
     for G (or H).  When supplied, these equality and inequality
     constraint functions must accept one vector argument and return a
     vector.

     The third and fourth arguments may also be 2-element cell arrays of
     function handles.  The first element should point to the constraint
     function and the second should point to a function that computes
     the gradient of the constraint function:

                      [ d f(x)   d f(x)        d f(x) ]
          transpose ( [ ------   -----   ...   ------ ] )
                      [  dx_1     dx_2          dx_N  ]

     The fifth and sixth arguments, LB and UB, contain lower and upper
     bounds on X.  These must be consistent with the equality and
     inequality constraints G and H.  If the arguments are vectors then
     X(i) is bound by LB(i) and UB(i).  A bound can also be a scalar in
     which case all elements of X will share the same bound.  If only
     one bound (lb, ub) is specified then the other will default to
     (-REALMAX, +REALMAX).

     The seventh argument MAXITER specifies the maximum number of
     iterations.  The default value is 100.

     The eighth argument TOLERANCE specifies the tolerance for the
     stopping criteria.  The default value is ‘sqrt (eps)’.

     The value returned in INFO may be one of the following:

     101
          The algorithm terminated normally.  All constraints meet the
          specified tolerance.

     102
          The BFGS update failed.

     103
          The maximum number of iterations was reached.

     104
          The stepsize has become too small, i.e., delta X, is less than
          ‘TOL * norm (x)’.

     An example of calling ‘sqp’:

          function r = g (x)
            r = [ sumsq(x)-10;
                  x(2)*x(3)-5*x(4)*x(5);
                  x(1)^3+x(2)^3+1 ];
          endfunction

          function obj = phi (x)
            obj = exp (prod (x)) - 0.5*(x(1)^3+x(2)^3+1)^2;
          endfunction

          x0 = [-1.8; 1.7; 1.9; -0.8; -0.8];

          [x, obj, info, iter, nf, lambda] = sqp (x0, @phi, @g, [])

          x =

            -1.71714
             1.59571
             1.82725
            -0.76364
            -0.76364

          obj = 0.053950
          info = 101
          iter = 8
          nf = 10
          lambda =

            -0.0401627
             0.0379578
            -0.0052227

25.4 Linear Least Squares
=========================

Octave also supports linear least squares minimization.  That is, Octave
can find the parameter b such that the model y = x*b fits data (x,y) as
well as possible, assuming zero-mean Gaussian noise.  If the noise is
assumed to be isotropic the problem can be solved using the ‘\’ or ‘/’
operators, or the ‘ols’ function.  In the general case where the noise
is assumed to be anisotropic the ‘gls’ is needed.

 -- : [BETA, SIGMA, R] = ols (Y, X)
     Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation.

     OLS applies to the multivariate model Y = X*B + E where Y is a
     t-by-p matrix, X is a t-by-k matrix, B is a k-by-p matrix, and E is
     a t-by-p matrix.

     Each row of Y is a p-variate observation in which each column
     represents a variable.  Likewise, the rows of X represent k-variate
     observations or possibly designed values.  Furthermore, the
     collection of observations X must be of adequate rank, k, otherwise
     B cannot be uniquely estimated.

     The observation errors, E, are assumed to originate from an
     underlying p-variate distribution with zero mean and p-by-p
     covariance matrix S, both constant conditioned on X.  Furthermore,
     the matrix S is constant with respect to each observation such that
     ‘mean (E) = 0’ and ‘cov (vec (E)) = kron (S, I)’.  (For cases that
     don’t meet this criteria, such as autocorrelated errors, see
     generalized least squares, gls, for more efficient estimations.)

     The return values BETA, SIGMA, and R are defined as follows.

     BETA
          The OLS estimator for matrix B.  BETA is calculated directly
          via ‘inv (X'*X) * X' * Y’ if the matrix ‘X'*X’ is of full
          rank.  Otherwise, ‘BETA = pinv (X) * Y’ where ‘pinv (X)’
          denotes the pseudoinverse of X.

     SIGMA
          The OLS estimator for the matrix S,

               SIGMA = (Y-X*BETA)' * (Y-X*BETA) / (t-rank(X))

     R
          The matrix of OLS residuals, ‘R = Y - X*BETA’.

     See also: *note gls: XREFgls, *note pinv: XREFpinv.

 -- : [BETA, V, R] = gls (Y, X, O)
     Generalized least squares (GLS) model.

     Perform a generalized least squares estimation for the multivariate
     model Y = X*B + E where Y is a t-by-p matrix, X is a t-by-k matrix,
     B is a k-by-p matrix and E is a t-by-p matrix.

     Each row of Y is a p-variate observation in which each column
     represents a variable.  Likewise, the rows of X represent k-variate
     observations or possibly designed values.  Furthermore, the
     collection of observations X must be of adequate rank, k, otherwise
     B cannot be uniquely estimated.

     The observation errors, E, are assumed to originate from an
     underlying p-variate distribution with zero mean but possibly
     heteroscedastic observations.  That is, in general, ‘mean (E) = 0’
     and ‘cov (vec (E)) = (s^2)*O’ in which s is a scalar and O is a
     t*p-by-t*p matrix.

     The return values BETA, V, and R are defined as follows.

     BETA
          The GLS estimator for matrix B.

     V
          The GLS estimator for scalar s^2.

     R
          The matrix of GLS residuals, R = Y - X*BETA.

     See also: *note ols: XREFols.

 -- : X = lsqnonneg (C, D)
 -- : X = lsqnonneg (C, D, X0)
 -- : X = lsqnonneg (C, D, X0, OPTIONS)
 -- : [X, RESNORM] = lsqnonneg (...)

 -- : [X, RESNORM, RESIDUAL, EXITFLAG, OUTPUT, LAMBDA] = lsqnonneg (...)

     Minimize ‘norm (C*X - D)’ subject to ‘X >= 0’.

     C and D must be real matrices.

     X0 is an optional initial guess for the solution X.

     OPTIONS is an options structure to change the behavior of the
     algorithm (*note ‘optimset’: XREFoptimset.).  ‘lsqnonneg’
     recognizes these options: "MaxIter", "TolX".

     Outputs:

     RESNORM
          The squared 2-norm of the residual: ‘norm (C*X-D)^2’

     RESIDUAL
          The residual: ‘D-C*X’

     EXITFLAG
          An indicator of convergence.  0 indicates that the iteration
          count was exceeded, and therefore convergence was not reached;
          >0 indicates that the algorithm converged.  (The algorithm is
          stable and will converge given enough iterations.)

     OUTPUT
          A structure with two fields:

             • "algorithm": The algorithm used ("nnls")

             • "iterations": The number of iterations taken.

     LAMBDA
          Undocumented output

     See also: *note pqpnonneg: XREFpqpnonneg, *note lscov: XREFlscov,
     *note optimset: XREFoptimset.

 -- : X = lscov (A, B)
 -- : X = lscov (A, B, V)
 -- : X = lscov (A, B, V, ALG)
 -- : [X, STDX, MSE, S] = lscov (...)

     Compute a generalized linear least squares fit.

     Estimate X under the model B = AX + W, where the noise W is assumed
     to follow a normal distribution with covariance matrix {\sigma^2}
     V.

     If the size of the coefficient matrix A is n-by-p, the size of the
     vector/array of constant terms B must be n-by-k.

     The optional input argument V may be an n-element vector of
     positive weights (inverse variances), or an n-by-n symmetric
     positive semi-definite matrix representing the covariance of B.  If
     V is not supplied, the ordinary least squares solution is returned.

     The ALG input argument, a guidance on solution method to use, is
     currently ignored.

     Besides the least-squares estimate matrix X (p-by-k), the function
     also returns STDX (p-by-k), the error standard deviation of
     estimated X; MSE (k-by-1), the estimated data error covariance
     scale factors (\sigma^2); and S (p-by-p, or p-by-p-by-k if k > 1),
     the error covariance of X.

 -- : optimset ()
 -- : OPTIONS = optimset ()
 -- : OPTIONS = optimset (PAR, VAL, ...)
 -- : OPTIONS = optimset (OLD, PAR, VAL, ...)
 -- : OPTIONS = optimset (OLD, NEW)
     Create options structure for optimization functions.

     When called without any input or output arguments, ‘optimset’
     prints a list of all valid optimization parameters.

     When called with one output and no inputs, return an options
     structure with all valid option parameters initialized to ‘[]’.

     When called with a list of parameter/value pairs, return an options
     structure with only the named parameters initialized.

     When the first input is an existing options structure OLD, the
     values are updated from either the PAR/VAL list or from the options
     structure NEW.

     Valid parameters are:

          are:

          "off" [default]
               No display.

          "iter"
               Display intermediate results for every loop iteration.

          "final"
               Display the result of the final loop iteration.

          "notify"
               Display the result of the final loop iteration if the
               function has failed to converge.

     FinDiffType

     FunValCheck
          When enabled, display an error if the objective function
          returns an invalid value (a complex number, NaN, or Inf).
          Must be set to "on" or "off" [default].  Note: the functions
          ‘fzero’ and ‘fminbnd’ correctly handle Inf values and only
          complex values or NaN will cause an error in this case.

     GradObj
          When set to "on", the function to be minimized must return a
          second argument which is the gradient, or first derivative, of
          the function at the point X.  If set to "off" [default], the
          gradient is computed via finite differences.

     Jacobian
          When set to "on", the function to be minimized must return a
          second argument which is the Jacobian, or first derivative, of
          the function at the point X.  If set to "off" [default], the
          Jacobian is computed via finite differences.

     MaxFunEvals
          Maximum number of function evaluations before optimization
          stops.  Must be a positive integer.

     MaxIter
          Maximum number of algorithm iterations before optimization
          stops.  Must be a positive integer.

     OutputFcn
          A user-defined function executed once per algorithm iteration.

     TolFun
          Termination criterion for the function output.  If the
          difference in the calculated objective function between one
          algorithm iteration and the next is less than ‘TolFun’ the
          optimization stops.  Must be a positive scalar.

     TolX
          Termination criterion for the function input.  If the
          difference in X, the current search point, between one
          algorithm iteration and the next is less than ‘TolX’ the
          optimization stops.  Must be a positive scalar.
